A flower pot rolls out of a window 10m above the ground. How fast is it falling just as it smacks into the ground?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
From Example~\ref*{eg:fallingBallB}, we know that an object falling from rest on the Earth
is subject to the acceleration due to gravity, $9.8~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}$. So, if $h(t)$ is the height of the flower pot $t$ seconds after it rolls out the window, then $h''(t)=-9.8$. (We make the acceleration negative, since the measure ``height"" has ``up"" as the positive direction, while gravity pulls the pot in the negative direction, ``down."")

Then $h'(t)$ is a function whose derivative is the constant $-9.8$ and with $h'(0)=0$ (since the object fell, instead of being thrown up or down), so $h'(t)=-9.8t$.

What we want to know is $h'(t)$ at the time $t$ when the pot hits the ground. We don't know yet exactly what time that happens, so we go a little farther and find an expression for $h(t)$. The function $h(t)$ has derivative $-9.8t$ and $h(0)=10$, so (again following the ideas in Example~\ref*{eg:fallingBallB})
\[h(t)=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+10\]
Now, we can find the time when the pot hits the ground: it is the time when $h(t)=0$\\ (and $t>0$).
\begin{align*}
0&=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+10\\
\frac{9.8}{2}t^2&=10\\
t^2&=\frac{20}{9.8}\\
t&=+\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\approx1.4 ~\mathrm{sec}
\intertext{The velocity of the pot at this time is}
h'\left(\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\right)&=-9.8\left(\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\right)=-\sqrt{20\cdot 9.8}
=-14 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}
\end{align*}

So, the pot is falling at 14 metres per second, just as it hits the ground.

A flower pot rolls out of a window 10m above the ground. How fast is it falling just as it smacks into the ground?
\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The flower pot is in free fall, so its acceleration is 9.8m/s^2. We can use the equation of motion for a falling object to find its velocity just as it hits the ground:

$$v = \sqrt{2a(h)}$$

where v is the velocity of the object, a is its acceleration, and h is its height above the ground. Substituting the values of a and h into this equation, we get:

$$v = \sqrt{2(9.8)(10)} = 4.35m/s$$

Final"," The model uses a correct physics formula ($v = \sqrt{2ah}$) for a falling object starting from rest. The calculation of $\sqrt{2(9.8)(10)}$ should yield $\sqrt{196} = 14 \, \text{m/s}$. However, the model states the result as $4.35 \, \text{m/s}$, which is incorrect. The final answer does not match the gold answer due to a calculation error. ",False

A peregrine falcon can dive at a speed of 325 kph. If you were to drop a stone, how high up would you have to be so that the stone reached the same speed in its fall?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is $9.8$ metres per second squared. So, the object's velocity $t$ seconds after being dropped is
\[v(t)=9.8t~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\]
We want $v(t)$ to be the speed of the peregrine's dive, so we should convert that to metres per second:
\[325~\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{hr}}\cdot
\left(\frac{1000~\mathrm{m}}{1~\mathrm{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1~\mathrm{hr}}{3600~\mathrm{sec}}\right)=\frac{1625}{18}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\]
The stone will reach this velocity when
\[9.8t=\frac{1625}{18}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad t=\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\]

What is left to figure out is how far the stone will fall in this time. The position of the stone $s(t)$ has derivative $9.8t$, so
\[s(t)=4.9t^2\]
if we take $s(0)=0$. So, if the stone falls for $\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}$ seconds, in that time it travels
\[s\left(\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\right)=4.9\left(\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\right)^2\approx 416 ~\mathrm{m}\]
So, you would have to drop a stone from about 416 metres for it to fall as fast as the falcon.

\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The stone will accelerate due to gravity at a rate of 9.8 m/s². To reach a speed of 325 kph, the stone would have to travel a distance of:

$$v = u + at$$

where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.

Substituting the values into this equation, we get:

$$325 = 0 + 9.8t$$

$$t = \frac{325}{9.8} = 33.3 seconds$$"," The model made a critical error by not converting the speed from kph to m/s before using it in the kinematic equation with acceleration in m/s². This leads to an incorrect calculation for time. Furthermore, the question asks for the height (distance fallen), but the model only calculates the time and does not proceed to find the distance. Therefore, the final answer is incorrect and incomplete. ",False

Use a 5th order Maclaurin polynomial for $6\arctan x$ to approximate $\pi$.

We note that $6\arctan\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt3}\right)=6\left(\dfrac{\pi}{6}\right)=\pi$. We will find the 5th order Maclaurin polynomial $T_5(x)$ for $f(x)=6\arctan x$.
Then $\pi=f\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \approx T_5\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)$. Let's begin by finding the first five derivatives of $f(x)=6\arctan x$.

**Solution:**

The Maclaurin series for $6\arctan x$ is given by

$$6\arctan x = 6x - \frac{6x^3}{3!} + \frac{6x^5}{5!} - \cdots$$

How fast is the volume between the spheres (inside the big sphere and outside the small sphere) changing when the bigger sphere has a radius twice as large as the smaller?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The volume between the spheres, while the little one is inside the big one, is
\[V=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 - \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
Differentiating implicitly with respect to $t$:
\[\diff{V}{t}=4\pi R^2\diff{R}{t}-4\pi r^2\diff{r}{t}\]

We differentiate $R=10+2t$ and $r=6t$ to find $\ds\diff{R}{t}=2$ and $\ds\diff{r}{t}=6$. When $R=2r$, $10+2t=2(6t)$, so $t=1$. When $t=1$, $R=12$ and $r=6$. So:
\[\diff{V}{t}=4\pi\left(12^2\right)(2)-4\pi\left(6^2\right)(6)=288\pi\]
So the volume between the two spheres is increasing at $288\pi$ cubic units per unit time.

Remark: when the radius of the inner sphere increases, we are ``subtracting"" more area. Since the radius of the inner sphere grows faster than the radius of the outer sphere, we might expect the area between the spheres to be decreasing. Although the radius of the outer sphere grows more slowly, a small increase in the radius of the outer sphere results in a larger change in volume than the same increase in the radius of the inner sphere. So, a result showing that the volume between the spheres is increasing is not unreasonable.

After $t$ seconds of smooshing the bottle, $a=5+t$ cm. The perimeter of the cross section is unchanged as the bottle deforms. The perimeter of an ellipse is actually quite difficult to calculate, but we will use an approximation derived by Ramanujan and assume that the perimeter $p$ of our ellipse is

\item Suppose the bottle was full when its cross section was a circle. How fast is the water spilling out when $a$ is twice as big as $b$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
(a) Since the perimeter of the bottle is unchanged (you aren't stretching the plastic), it is always the same as the perimeter before it was smooshed, which is the circumference of a circle of radius 5, or $2\pi(5)=10\pi$. So, using our approximation for the perimeter of an ellipse,
\begin{align*}
10\pi&=\pi\left[3(a+b)-\sqrt{(a+3b)(3a+b)}\right]\\
10&=3(a+b)-\sqrt{(a+3b)(3a+b)}

(b) The area of the base of the bottle is $\pi a b$
(see Section~\ref*{app sec areas}), and its height is 20 cm, so the volume of the bottle is
\[V=20\pi a b\]

(c) As you smoosh the bottle, its volume decreases, so the water spills out. (If it turns out that the volume is increasing, then no water is spilling out--but life experience suggests, and our calculations verify, that this is not the case.)
The water will spill out at a rate of $-\ds\diff{V}{t}$ cubic centimetres per second, where $V$ is the volume inside the bottle. We know something about $a$ and $\ds\diff{a}{t}$, so a reasonable plan is to differentiate the equation from (b) (relating $V$ and $a$) with respect to $t$.

Using the product rule, we differentiate the equation in (b) implicitly with respect to $t$ and get
\[\diff{V}{t}=20\pi\left(\diff{a}{t}b+a\diff{b}{t}\right)\]

So, we need to find the values of \textcolor{red}{$a$}, \textcolor{red}{$b$},
\textcolor{red}{$\ds\diff{a}{t}$}, and \textcolor{red}{$\ds\diff{b}{t}$} at the moment when $a=2b$.

Remark: the algebra in this problem got a little nasty, but the method behind its solution is no more difficult than most of the problems in this section. One of the reasons why calculus is so widely taught in universities is to give you lots of practice with problem-solving: taking a big problem, breaking it into pieces you can manage, solving the pieces, and getting a solution.

A problem like this can sometimes derail people. Breaking it up into pieces isn't so hard, but when you actually do those pieces, you can get confused and forget why you are doing the calculations you're doing. If you find yourself in this situation, look back a few steps to remind yourself why you started the calculation you just did. It can also be helpful to write notes, like
``We are trying to find $\diff{V}{t}$. We already know that
                $\diff{V}{t} = ...$. We still need to find $a$, $b$,
                $\diff{a}{t}$ and $\diff{b}{t}$.""

Remark: here is a check on the reasonableness of our answer.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The circumference of the original circular cross section is $2\pi(5)=10\pi
\approx 31.4\mathrm{cm}$. When $a$ hits 
$\frac{10\pi}{4}\approx 7.9\mathrm{cm}$, the bottle is completely flattened
and so has volume $0$. This happens at time $t=7.9-5=2.9\mathrm{sec}$.
\item
The original bottle has volume $20\times \pi(5^2)\approx 1571\mathrm{cm}^3$.

So, on average, the volume decreased at a rate of $\frac{1571}{2.9}

for some $z$ between $25$ and $27$. The error is exactly
\[\left|\frac{1}{2} f''(z)(25-27)^2\right|
=\left|\frac{1}{2} \left(-\frac{2}{9}x^{-5/3}\right)(-2)^2\right|

**Solution:**

The function $f(x)=x^{1/3}$ is increasing and concave upward. Therefore, the best linear approximation for $f(x)$ near $x=4$ is

$$L(x)=f(4)+f'(4)(x-4)=4+ \frac{1}{3}(x-4)$$

Using this linear approximation, we can estimate

$$5^{2/3}\approx L(5)=4+\frac{1}{3}(5-4)=4.333$$

The quadratic approximation for $f(x)$ near $x"," The model makes fundamental errors from the beginning.
1.  **Incorrect Function Analysis:** The model states ""$f(x)=x^{1/3}$ is increasing and concave upward."" This is incorrect; $f''(x) = -\frac{2}{9}x^{-5/3}$, which is negative for $x>0$, meaning $f(x)$ is concave *downward*.
2.  **Inappropriate Choice of $x_0$:** The problem asks to estimate $5^{2/3}$, which is $25^{1/3}$. For a linear or quadratic approximation of $f(x)=x^{1/3}$, one should choose an $x_0$ close to $25$ for which $x_0^{1/3}$ is easily computable (i.e., $x_0$ is a perfect cube). The appropriate choice is $x_0=27$. The model chooses $x_0=4$, which is neither close to $25$ nor does $4^{1/3}$ yield an integer or easily calculable value.
3.  **Incorrect Evaluation of $f(x_0)$ and $f'(x_0)$:** Based on its choice of $x_0=4$, the model states ""$f(4)+f'(4)(x-4)=4+ \frac{1}{3}(x-4)$"". For $f(x)=x^{1/3}$, $f(4)=4^{1/3} \neq 4$ and $f'(4)=\frac{1}{3}4^{-2/3} \neq \frac{1}{3}$. This indicates a misunderstanding of the function itself or a severe calculation error.
4.  **Incorrect Estimate for Part (a):** Due to the previous errors, the estimate for $5^{2/3}$ is $4.333$, which is significantly different from the gold answer's $2.9259$ (and incorrect).
5.  **Incompleteness:** The model's answer for part (b) is incomplete (""The quadratic approximation for $f(x)$ near $x$"") and part (c) is not addressed at all.

Consider the function $h(x)=2x^3-24x+1$.
What are the coordinates of the local maximum of $h(x)$? What are the coordinates of the local minimum of $h(x)$?

Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial, it has no singular points. We compute its critical points:
\begin{align*}
h'(x)&=6x^2-24\\
0&=6x^2-24\\
x&=\pm2
\end{align*}
Notice as $x\to\infty$, $h(x)\to\infty$, and as $x\to-\infty$ $h(x)\to-\infty$. So Theorem~\ref*{thm:maxMinOnR} doesn't exactly apply. Instead, let's consider the signs of $h'(x)$.

$$
px^2+2(1+p)xz=A \qquad\hbox{or}\quad z=\dfrac{A-px^2}{2(1+p)x}

So

is positive (i.e. $V(x)$ is increasing) for $x< \sqrt{\dfrac{A}{3p}}$ and
is negative (i.e. $V(x)$ is decreasing) for $x>\sqrt{\dfrac{A}{3p}}$. So
the pan of maximum volume has dimensions $x=\sqrt{\dfrac{A}{3p}}$,

**Solution:**

The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula

$$V = xyZ$$

where $V$ is the volume, $x$ is the length, $y$ is the width, and $Z$ is the height.

Since the area of the base is fixed, we can write

$$A = xy = A$$

$$V = AZ$$

Final Answer:  $\Delta y = f'(2)(1)=15$."," The question asks for a True/False answer regarding the statement $\Delta y = f'(2)(1)=25$.

1.  **Calculate $\Delta y$**:
    $f(x) = 7x^2 - 3x + 4$
    $x_0 = 2$, $\Delta x = 1$
    $\Delta y = f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0) = f(2+1) - f(2) = f(3) - f(2)$
    $f(3) = 7(3)^2 - 3(3) + 4 = 7(9) - 9 + 4 = 63 - 9 + 4 = 58$
    $f(2) = 7(2)^2 - 3(2) + 4 = 7(4) - 6 + 4 = 28 - 6 + 4 = 26$
    So, $\Delta y = 58 - 26 = 32$.

2.  **Calculate $f'(2)(1)$**:
    $f'(x) = 14x - 3$
    $f'(2) = 14(2) - 3 = 28 - 3 = 25$
    So, $f'(2)(1) = 25 \times 1 = 25$.

The statement in the question is ""$\Delta y = f'(2)(1)=25$"". Since $\Delta y = 32$ and $f'(2)(1) = 25$, the statement $32 = 25$ is False. The gold answer correctly identifies this as ""False"".

The model's solution contains significant errors:
*   The model calculates $\Delta y = f(3) - f(2) = 25 - 10 = 15$. This is incorrect. As calculated above, $f(3)=58$ and $f(2)=26$, so $\Delta y = 32$. The values $25$ and $10$ used by the model for $f(3)$ and $f(2)$ are incorrect.

**Solution:**

The Taylor series for the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ is given by

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} x^n$$

$$\varepsilon_N = \frac{M_N}{n!} x^N$$

**Solution:**

The limit of this function can be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule. Taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator, we get:

$$\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{x-x\cos x}{x-\sin x}=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{1+x\sin x}{1-\cos x}=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{1}{1}=1$$

1.  **Missing Answers for Parts (a), (b), (c):** The model only attempts to answer part (d), completely omitting explicit answers for parts (a), (b), and (c).
2.  **Incorrect Function:** For part (d), the model assumes a specific function $f(x) = \sin(x) + x^2/15$, which is incorrect. The problem asks for the approximation for a general function $f(x)$. The function shown in the diagram is an example, not the function to be used for the general approximation.
3.  **Incorrect Summation Index:** The problem specifies taking samples at ""the left endpoint of each piece, starting with $a$."" This means the sample points are $a, a+\Delta x, a+2\Delta x, \ldots, a+(n-1)\Delta x$. The gold answer correctly uses $a+(i-1)\frac{b-a}{n}$ for the $i$-th term (with $i$ from 1 to $n$). The model uses $a+i\Delta x$, which would correspond to samples at $a+\Delta x, a+2\Delta x, \ldots, a+n\Delta x$, effectively missing the first sample at $a$ and including a sample at $b$ (the right endpoint of the last interval), which is inconsistent with the problem's description of ""left endpoint of each piece.""
4.  **Incorrect $\Delta x$ Definition:** The model states $\Delta x = \frac{b}{n}$, which is incorrect. The interval length is $b-a$, and it's cut into $n$ pieces, so the distance between consecutive sample points should be $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$.

Force is mass $\times$ acceleration (with acceleration equal to $g$ in this problem), and both in this scenario are constant, so we don't need an integral--only a product--to calculate the force acting on the block.

To find the force in newtons, recall one newton is one $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}$, so we need the mass of our block in kg. Specifically, our block has mass $\frac{3}{1000}$ kg. So, the force involved is

**Solution:**

The centroid of a plane figure is given by the formulas

$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{M} \int_0^b \int_0^a x(y) dy dx$$

$$\bar{y}=\frac{1}{M} \int_0^b \int_0^a y(x) dy dx$$

where M is the total mass of the figure,

$$M=\int_0^b \int_0^a  dy dx$$

In this problem, the figure is bounded by the curves $y=e^x$, $", The model's answer is incomplete. It provides the general formulas for the centroid but stops abruptly without performing any calculations or providing a final answer. ,False

**Solution:**

The differential equation is given by

$$y'=y-\frac{x}{2}$$

This equation can be solved using the following steps:

1. Separate the variables and integrate both sides with respect to $x$.
2. Use the separation of variables technique to find the solution.
3. The solution is given by

$$y=e^x+x-1$$

Final Answer: The solution to the differential equation is given by

$$y=e^x+x-1$$"," The model completely failed to address parts (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of the question. Instead, it attempted to solve the differential equation analytically, which was not the primary task for any of the sub-questions. Furthermore, the analytical solution provided by the model ($y=e^x+x-1$) is incorrect, and the method it suggested (separation of variables) is also incorrect as the given differential equation is not separable.

**SOLUTION:**

The velocity is decreasing at a rate proportional to the square of the velocity, so we can write the following differential equation:

$$v'(t) = -k v^2$$

where $k$ is a constant. We know that $v=200$ when $t=1$, so we can use this information to find $k$:

$$200 = v(1) = \int_0^1 v(t) dt = \int_0^1 400 e^{-kt} dt$$

$$k = \frac{1}{40"," The model correctly states the differential equation for part (a). However, it makes a fundamental error in solving the differential equation in part (b). The model incorrectly assumes the solution is of the form $v(t) = 400e^{-kt}$, which is the solution for $\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv$, not $\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv^2$. It also incorrectly equates $v(1)$ to an integral of $v(t)$. Due to this critical error, the model cannot correctly determine the constant $k$ or the function $v(t)$, and thus cannot solve part (c).

**Solution:**

The osculating circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of contact. The tangent line is parallel to the $x$-axis in this case. Therefore, the osculating circle will be perpendicular to the $x$-axis, and $\hB$ will be pointing out of the paper towards the reader.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: $\hB$ points out of the paper towards the reader."," The model fails to label $\hT$ and $\hN$ on the sketch, which was an explicit part of the question. Furthermore, the reasoning provided by the model for determining the direction of $\hB$ is incorrect. Specifically, ""The osculating circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of contact"" is false (the osculating plane contains the tangent and normal, and is perpendicular to $\hB$), and ""The tangent line is parallel to the $x$-axis in this case"" is also false based on the provided curve and the indicated point.

The parametrization of a circle in the first quadrant can be found using the following equations:

$$y=a\sin\theta$$

This is incorrect; $\theta$ in this standard parametrization is the angle between the radius vector and the positive $x$-axis. This fundamental misunderstanding propagates errors.

It stops abruptly after $\vec{r}(\theta)=a\cos\theta\mathbf$. The correct approach for part (a) is to express $x$ in terms of $y$ directly from $x^2+y^2=a^2$, yielding $x=\sqrt{a^2-y^2}$ (since $x \ge 0$ in the first quadrant), leading to $\vec{r}(y) = \sqrt{a^2-y^2}\,\mathbf{i} + y\,\mathbf{j}$.

**Solution:**

The velocity vector of a particle with position function \vr(t) is given by

$$\vr'(t) = \frac{d\vr(t)}{dt} = 5\sqrt{2}\hi + 5e^{5t}\hj - 5e^{-5t}\hk$$

The speed of the particle is given by the magnitude of the velocity vector:

$$|\vv(t)| = \sqrt{\left(\vr'(t)\cdot\vr'(t)\right)} = \sqrt{10 + e^{10t} + e^{-10t","
The model makes an error in calculating the velocity vector, specifically the k-component. The derivative of $-e^{-5t}$ is $5e^{-5t}$, not $-5e^{-5t}$ as stated by the model. While this specific sign error does not affect the magnitude calculation (since the term is squared), the model subsequently makes a significant arithmetic error when calculating the magnitude.

The correct magnitude calculation is:
$|\vv(t)| = \sqrt{(5\sqrt{2})^2 + (5e^{5t})^2 + (5e^{-5t})^2}$
$= \sqrt{50 + 25e^{10t} + 25e^{-10t}}$
$= \sqrt{25(2 + e^{10t} + e^{-10t})}$
$= 5\sqrt{2 + e^{10t} + e^{-10t}}$

The model's final answer is stated as $\sqrt{10 + e^{10t} + e^{-10t}}$, which corresponds to option (c). This result is mathematically incorrect based on the derived velocity components (whether correct or the model's incorrect ones).
The correct answer, derived from the gold solution, is $5(e^{5t} + e^{-5t})$, which is equivalent to $\sqrt{25(2 + e^{10t} + e^{-10t})} = \sqrt{50 + 25e^{10t} + 25e^{-10t}}$.

**Solution:**

The arclength of a curve given by the vector function $\vr(t)= \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$, $t\in[a,b]$, is given by the formula

$$s(t)= \int_0^t \sqrt{\frac{dx(s)}{dt}^2 + \frac{dy(s)}{dt}^2 + \frac{dz(s)}{dt}^2} ds$$

**Solution:**

The curve $\cC$ is given by the intersection of the surfaces $z^2=12y$ and $18x=yz$. We can find a vector parametric equation for $\cC$ using the parameter $u=\frac{z}{6}$.

The parameterization is given by

$$\vec{r}(u)=(\frac{18u}{6}, \frac{u}{2}, 6u)$$

where $0\leq u\leq 1$.

The model's answer is incomplete and contains an error in the first part.

1.  **Part (a) - Parametric Equation:**

    *   **Model Answer:** $\vec{r}(u)=(\frac{18u}{6}, \frac{u}{2}, 6u) = (3u, \frac{u}{2}, 6u)$
    The model's parameterization is incorrect. Substituting $z=6u$ into the given surface equations:
    $z^2=12y \implies (6u)^2=12y \implies 36u^2=12y \implies y=3u^2$.
    $18x=yz \implies 18x=(3u^2)(6u) \implies 18x=18u^3 \implies x=u^3$.

**Solution:**

The given differential equation describes a projectile's motion with air resistance. It is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve this equation, we first find the characteristic polynomial:

$$\lambda^2+ \alpha\lambda+g=0$$

The roots of this polynomial are:

$$\lambda_1=\frac{-(\alpha\pm\sqrt{\alpha^2-4g})}{2}$$

**Solution:**

The given equation defines $y$ implicitly as a function of $x$ as

$$x^3y+y^3=10x$$

Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $x$, we get

$$3x^2y+y^3=10$$

At the point $(1,2)$, this equation becomes

$$3+8=10$$

$$11=10$$

Since this equation is not true, it means that the given equation does not define a function of $x$ at the point $(1,2)$. Therefore,"," The model's differentiation of the equation $x^3y+y^3=10x$ is incorrect. It derives $3x^2y+y^3=10$, which misses the $y'$ terms required for implicit differentiation. Due to this fundamental error, the model cannot compute $y'$ and incorrectly concludes that the equation does not define $y$ implicitly as a function of $x$ at the given point, contradicting the problem statement.

The function $f(x)$ is continuous over all real numbers, but it is only differentiable when $x \neq 0$. So, if we want to apply the MVT, our interval must consist of only positive numbers or only negative numbers: the interval $(-4,13)$ is not valid.

**Answer:**

The work has the correct application of the mean value theorem, but there is a mistake in calculating the derivative of $f(x)$. The derivative of $f(x)=\sqrt{|x|}$ is not simply $f'(x)=\frac{1}{13}$. Instead, it is

$$f'(x)= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{|x|}} \text{ sign}(x)$$

where ""sign(x)"" is the sign of the number x. With this correction, the proof is complete.

1.  **Incorrectly identifies the mistake:** The primary mistake in the given work is that the function $f(x)=\sqrt{|x|}$ is not differentiable at $x=0$, which is included in the interval $(-4,9)$. Therefore, the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) cannot be applied over this interval. The model incorrectly states that ""The work has the correct application of the mean value theorem"" and instead points to a ""mistake in calculating the derivative of $f(x)$"". The original work stated that $f'(x) = \frac{1}{13}$ *by the MVT*, meaning that a point $c$ exists where $f'(c)$ equals the average rate of change, not that the derivative *is* $1/13$. The model completely misses the crucial condition for applying MVT.
2.  **Fails to provide a correct proof:** The question asks to ""give a correct proof."" The model provides the general derivative formula for $f(x)=\sqrt{|x|}$ but does not use it to prove that a point exists where the tangent line has a slope of $1/13$.

When we say a function is differentiable without specifying a range, we mean that it is differentiable over its domain. The function $f(x)$ is differentiable when $x \neq 1$ for any values of $a$ and $b$; it is up to us to figure out which constants make it differentiable when $x=1$.

In order to be differentiable, a function must be continuous. The definition of continuity tells us that, for $f$ to be continuous at $x=1$, we need $\ds\lim_{x \to 1}f(x)=f(1)$. From the definition of $f$, we see $f(1)=a+b=\ds\lim_{x \to 1^-}f(x)$, so we need $\ds\lim_{x\to 1^+}f(x)=a+b$. Since $\ds\lim_{x \to 1^+}f(x)=e^1=e$, we specifically need
\[e=a+b.\]

Now, let's consider differentiability of $f$ at $x=1$. We need the following limit to exist:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}&
\intertext{In particular, we need the one-sided limits to exist and be equal:}
\textcolor{red}{\lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}}&=\textcolor{blue}{\lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}}
\intertext{If $h<0$, then $1+h<1$, so $f(1+h)=a(1+h)^2+b$. If $h>0$, then $1+h>1$, so $f(1+h)=e^{1+h}$. With this in mind, we begin to evaluate the one-sided limits:}
\color{red}\lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}&\color{red}=
\lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{[a(1+h)^2+b]-[a+b]}{h}\\

\lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{e^{1+h}-e^1}{h}\\
&\color{blue}=\left.\diff{}{x}\{e^x\}\right|_{x=1}=e^1=e

So, we also need
\[\textcolor{red}{2a}=\textcolor{blue}{e}\]

Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ that make $f$ differentiable are $a=b=\dfrac{e}{2}$.

Final Answer: <answer>. </context> Answer the following: <Question> \begin{question}[2009H]
Find constants $a$, $b$ so that the following function is differentiable:
\[
f(x) =\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
ax^2 + b & x \le 1\\
e^x     &  x > 1\end{array}\right.
\]
\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The function is defined by two different expressions for different intervals of $x$. To be differentiable, both expressions must be differentiable on their respective intervals.

For the first expression, $ax^2 + b$, to be differentiable, we need to ensure that $a$ and $b$ are constants. This is because the derivative of $ax^2 + b$ is $2ax$. Therefore, for this expression to be differentiable, we must have:

$$a = 2a$$

$$b = 0$$

For the second expression, $e^x$, to be differentiable, we"," The model's reasoning is fundamentally flawed from the beginning. It incorrectly states that for $ax^2+b$ to be differentiable, $a=2a$ (implying $a=0$) and $b=0$. A polynomial function like $ax^2+b$ is differentiable for any constant $a$ and $b$. The critical point for differentiability of a piecewise function is where the definitions change, in this case, at $x=1$. The model completely fails to address the conditions for continuity and equal derivatives at $x=1$, which are necessary for the function to be differentiable. The model does not reach a final answer.

$$\ds\diff{}{x}\left\{[f(x)]^{g(x)}\right\} = g(x)f'(x) [f(x)]^{g(x)-1} f(x).$$

Final Answer:

$$\ds\diff{}{x}\left\{[f(x)]^{g(x)}\right\} = g(x)f'(x) [f(x)]^{g(x)-1} f(x).$$"," The model's final answer is incorrect. The derivative of a function of the form $[f(x)]^{g(x)}$ (where both base and exponent are functions of $x$) requires logarithmic differentiation, leading to the formula:

Final Answer: <answer>. </context> Answer the following: <Question> \begin{question}
Consider a cube such that each side has length $s$. Name,
in order, the four vertices on the bottom of the cube $A, B, C, D$ and the
corresponding four vertices on the top of the cube $A', B', C', D'$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
Show that all edges of the tetrahedron $A'C'BD$ have the same length.
\item
Let $E$ be the center of the cube. Find the angle between $EA$ and $EC$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The tetrahedron $A'C'BD$ is formed by connecting the four vertices of the top of the cube to the four vertices of the bottom of the cube. Since the cube is a regular polyhedron, the four vertices of the top and the four vertices of the bottom are equidistant from the center of the cube. Therefore, all edges of the tetrahedron $A'C'BD$ have the same length.

The center of a cube is equidistant from all vertices of the cube. Let $E$ be the center of the cube. The angle between $EA$ and $EC$","
The model's answer for part (a) is incorrect. It states that ""all edges of the tetrahedron $A'C'BD$ have the same length"" based on an incorrect premise (""the four vertices of the top and the four vertices of the bottom are equidistant from the center of the cube. Therefore, all edges of the tetrahedron $A'C'BD$ have the same length.""). While it is true that all vertices are equidistant from the center, this property does not directly prove that the edges of the specified tetrahedron are all of the same length. The question asks to *show* this, which requires calculation (as done in the gold answer) or a more robust geometric argument. The model's argument is insufficient and based on a misapplication of geometric properties.

The model's answer for part (b) is incomplete. It sets up the problem but does not provide any calculation or a final answer for the angle between $EA$ and $EC$.

A marble is placed on the plane $ax+by+cz=d$. The coordinate
system has been chosen so that the positive $z$--axis points straight up.
The coefficient $c$ is nonzero and the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are not
both zero.
In which direction does the marble roll? 
Why were the conditions ``$c\ne 0$'' and ``$a,b$ not both zero'' imposed?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The marble is subject to two forces. The first, gravity, is
$-mg\,\hk$ with $m$ being the mass of the marble. The second is the normal
force imposed by the plane. This forces acts in a direction perpendicular
to the plane. One vector normal to the plane is $a\,\hi+b\,\hj+c\,\hk$. 
So the force due to the plane is $T\llt a,b,c\rgt$ with $T$ determined  by the
property that the net force perpendicular to the plane must be exactly
zero, so that the marble remains on the plane, neither digging into nor
flying off of it. The projection of the gravitational force onto the normal
vector $\llt a,b,c\rgt$ is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt\cdot\llt a,b,c\rgt}{|\llt a,b,c\rgt|^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt
=\frac{-mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt
\end{equation*}
The condition that determines $T$ is thus
\begin{equation*}
T\llt a,b,c\rgt+\frac{-mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt =0
\implies T=\frac{mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}
\end{equation*}
The total force on the marble is then (ignoring friction -- which will
have no effect on the direction of motion)
\begin{align*}
T\llt a,b,c\rgt-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt&=\frac{mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt\cr
&=mg\frac{c\llt a,b,c\rgt-\llt 0,0,a^2+b^2+c^2\rgt}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\cr
&=mg\frac{\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\cr
\end{align*}
The direction of motion $\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt$. If you want to turn
this into a unit vector, just divide by $\sqrt{(a^2+b^2)(a^2+b^2+c^2)}$.
Note that the direction vector in perpendicular $\llt a,b,c\rgt$ and hence is parallel
to the plane. If $c=0$, the plane is vertical. In this case, the marble
doesn't roll -- it falls straight down. If $a=b=0$, the plane is horizontal.
 In this case, the marble doesn't roll --- it remains stationary.

In which direction does the marble roll? 
Why were the conditions ``$c\ne 0$'' and ``$a,b$ not both zero'' imposed?
\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The marble will roll in the direction of the negative $x$-axis. This is because the coefficient $c$ is nonzero, which means that the marble will experience a force in the direction of the $z$-axis. This force will cause the marble to move in a plane perpendicular to the $x$-axis. The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, which means that the marble will not move in a straight line along the $z$-axis. Instead, it will move in a curved path.

Final Answer: The marble rolls in the direction of the negative $x$-"," The model's final answer for the direction the marble rolls, ""the negative $x$-axis"", is incorrect. The direction depends on the coefficients $a, b, c$ as derived in the gold answer (e.g., $\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt$). The model also fails to correctly explain why the conditions ``$c\ne 0$'' and ``$a,b$ not both zero'' were imposed.
1.  If $c=0$, the plane is vertical ($ax+by=d$), and the marble would fall straight down, not roll along the plane. The model's explanation about ""force in the direction of the $z$-axis"" and ""moving in a plane perpendicular to the $x$-axis"" is nonsensical.
2.  If $a=b=0$, the plane is horizontal ($cz=d$), and the marble would not roll at all; it would remain stationary. The model's reasoning that ""the marble will not move in a straight line along the $z$-axis"" is irrelevant and incorrect for this condition. ",False

(a) $AA'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and $BB'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ are opposite sides
of the quadrilateral $AA'B'B$. They have the same length 
and direction. The same is true for $AB=\llt -1,3,0\rgt $ and 
$A'B'=\llt -1,3,0\rgt $. So $AA'B'B$ is a parallelogram. Because, 
$AA'\cdot AB=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt -1,3,0\rgt =-4\ne 0$, 
the neighbouring edges of $AA'B'B$ are not perpendicular and so $AA'B'B$ 
is \emph{not} a rectangle.

$AA'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt =CC'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and 
$AC=\llt -1,0,4\rgt =A'C'=\llt -1,0,4\rgt $ and so is
a parallelogram. Because $AA'\cdot AC=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt -1,0,4\rgt = 0$, the neighbouring edges of $ACC'A'$ are perpendicular, so
$ACC'A'$ \emph{is} a rectangle.

Finally, the quadilateral $BCC'B'$ has opposing sides
$BB'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt =CC'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and 
$BC=\llt 0,-3,4\rgt =B'C'=\llt 0,-3,4\rgt $ and so is
a parallelogram. Because $BB'\cdot BC=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt 0,-3,4\rgt

$BCC'B'$ is \emph{not} a rectangle.

$\theta$ is the angle between $AB$ and $AC$. This is precisely 
$\half |AB\times AC|=\half|\llt -1,3,0\rgt \times\llt -1,0,4\rgt |

(d) The volume of the prism is the area of its base $ABC$,
 times its height, which is the length of $AA'$ times the cosine of the
angle between $AA'$ and the normal to $ABC$. This coincides with
$\half \llt 12,4,3\rgt \cdot\llt 4,0,1\rgt =\half(48+3)=\frac{51}{2}$, which is 
one half times the length of $\llt 12,4,3\rgt $ (the area of $ABC$)

(a) Let's use $z$ as the parameter and rename it to $t$.

-5y -5z = -5
\implies y = 1-z = 1-t\quad\text{ or }\quad y-1=-t

\llt x,y,z\rgt = \llt 10,12,0\rgt +t \llt 2,2,1\rgt

\end{equation*}
So the distance from the point  $(-3\,,\,1-t\,,\,t)$ on $L$
to the point $(10+2s\,,\,12+2s\,,\,s)$ on $M$ is the square root of
\begin{equation*}
D(s,t) = (13+2s)^2 +(11+2s+t)^2 +(s-t)^2

That distance is minimized when
\begin{align*}
0 = \pdiff{D}{s} &=4(13+2s) +4(11+2s+t) +2(s-t) \\
0 = \pdiff{D}{t} &=2(11+2s+t) -2(s-t)

Cleaning up those equations gives
\begin{align*}
18s +2t &= -96 \\
2s  +4t &=-22

or
\begin{align*}
9s +t &=-48 \tag{E1}\\
 s+2t &=-11 \tag{E2}

Subtracting (E2) from twice (E1) gives

Consider the sphere given by
$$
(x-1)^2+(y-2)^2+(z+1)^2=2
$$
Suppose that you are at the point $(2,2,0)$ on $S$, and you plan to follow
the shortest path on $S$ to $(2,1,-1)$. Express your initial direction
as a cross product.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Switch to a new coordinate system with
$$
X=x-1\qquad Y=y-2\qquad Z=z+1
$$
In this new coordinate system, the sphere has equation $X^2+Y^2+Z^2=2$.
So the sphere is centred at $(X,Y,Z)=(0,0,0)$ and has radius $\sqrt{2}$.
In the new coordinate system, the initial point $(x,y,z)=(2,2,0)$
has $(X,Y,Z)=(1,0,1)$ and our final point  $(x,y,z)=(2,1,-1)$
has $(X,Y,Z)=(1,-1,0)$. Call the initial point $P$ and the final point
$Q$. The shortest path will follow the great circle from $P$ to $Q$.

\begin{center}

}%
A great circle on a sphere is the intersection of the sphere with a plane
that contains the centre of the sphere. Our strategy for finding the initial
direction will be based on two observations.
\begin{itemize}
\item The shortest path lies on the plane $\Pi$ that contains the origin and the points $P$ and $Q$. Since the shortest path lies on $\Pi$,
our direction vector must also lie on $\Pi$ and hence must
be perpendicular to the normal vector to $\Pi$.
\item
The shortest path also remains on the sphere, so our initial direction
must also be perpendicular to the normal vector to 
the sphere at our initial point $P$. 
\end{itemize}
As our initial direction is perpendicular to the two normal vectors,
it is parallel to their cross product.

So our main job is to find normal vectors to the plane $\Pi$ and to the
sphere at $P$. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item One way to find a normal vector to $\Pi$ is to guess an equation for
$\Pi$. As $(0,0,0)$ is on $\Pi$, $(0,0,0)$ must obey $\Pi$'s equation.
So $\Pi$'s equation must be of the form $aX+bY+cZ=0$. That $(X,Y,Z)=(1,0,1)$ 
is on $\Pi$ forces $a+c=0$.   That $(X,Y,Z)=(1,-1,0)$ is on $\Pi$ forces 
$a-b=0$. So we may take $a=1$, $b=1$ and $c=-1$. That is, $\Pi$ is   
$X+Y-Z=0$.  (Check that all three points $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,1)$ and
$(1,-1,0)$ do indeed obey $X+Y-Z=0$.) A normal vector to $\Pi$ is
$\llt 1,1,-1\rgt$.
\item A second way to find a normal vector to $\Pi$ is to observe that
both
\begin{itemize}
\item
the vector from $(0,0,0)$ to $(1,0,1)$, that is $\llt 1,0,1\rgt$, 
lies completely inside $\Pi$ and
\item
the vector from $(0,0,0)$ to $(1,-1,0)$, that is $\llt 1,-1,0\rgt$, 
lies completely inside $\Pi$.
\end{itemize}
So the vector
\begin{equation*}
\llt 1,0,1\rgt\times\llt 1,-1,0\rgt
=\det\left[\begin{matrix}
                     \hi & \hj & \hk \\
                     1   &  0  & 1 \\
                     1   &  -1  & 0
                \end{matrix}\right]
=\hi + \hj -\hk
\end{equation*}
is perpendicular to $\Pi$.
\item
The vector from the centre of the sphere to the point $P$ on the sphere
is perpendicular to the sphere at $P$. So a normal vector to 
the sphere at our initial point $(X,Y,Z)=(1,0,1)$ is $\llt 1,0,1\rgt$.
\end{itemize}
Since our initial direction\footnote{Note that the change of coordinates
$X=x-1$, $Y=y-2$, $Z=z+1$ has absolutely no effect on any velocity or direction
vector. If our position at time $t$ is $(x(t),y(t),z(t))$ in the
original coordinate system, then it is $(X(t),Y(t),Z(t))
=(x(t)-1,y(t)-2,z(t)+1)$ in the new coordinate system. The velocity
vectors in the two coordinate systems $\llt x'(t),y'(t),z'(t)\rgt
=\llt X'(t),Y'(t),Z'(t)\rgt$ are identical.}

it must be one of  $\pm\llt 1,1,-1\rgt\times\llt 1,0,1\rgt$. 
To get from $(1,0,1)$ to $(1,-1,0)$ by the shortest path, our $Z$ 
coordinate should decrease from $1$ to $0$. So the $Z$ coordinate of 
our initial direction should be negative. This is the case for

**Solution:**

The shortest path on a sphere between two points is always given by the great-circle arc. To find the direction of the shortest path, we first need to find the unit vector that points from the point $(2,2,0)$ to the point $(2,1,-1)$. This vector is given by

Set $\vF = (x + y, x + z, y + z)$.
Then $\vnabla\cdot\vF = 2$. That's really simple. So let's

$\dblInt_S\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}$, with $\hn$ denoting the outward normal to $S$.
$S$ is \emph{not} the boundary of a solid, so we cannot compute
$\dblInt_S\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}$ by applying the divergence theorem directly.

\begin{equation*}
V = \Set{(x,y,z)}{x^2+z^2\le 4,\ 0\le y\le 3}

two disks

The figure on the right above shows the parts of $S$, $V$, $D_l$ 
and $D_r$ that are  in the first octant.

The outward normal to $D_r$ is $\hj$ and the outward normal to $D_l$ is
$-\hj$, to the divergence theorem gives

**Solution:**

The key to solving this problem is to identify the correct normal vector to each surface. The normal vector is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude of 1. To find the normal vector, we need to take the derivative of the surface equation with respect to each variable and use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the vector. Once we have the normal vector, we can use Stokes' theorem to calculate the integral.

Final Answer: The normal vectors to the surfaces in the sketches are shown in the figures below.

We shall apply Stokes' Theorem. The curl of $\vF$ is

\begin{align*}

**Final Answer:**

**The vector field $\vF$ is not conservative. The domain $D$ is a square in the plane $z = 2$, and it is simply connected.**"," The model's final answer is incomplete and contains significant errors.
1.  **Part (a) - Domain D:** The model states ""The domain $D$ is a square in the plane $z = 2$"". This is incorrect. The domain $D$ is the domain of the vector field $\vF$, which is $D=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x>0,\ y>0,\ z>0}$. The square described is the region of integration for part (d), not the domain of the vector field.
2.  **Part (b) - Properties of D:** The model's statement about $D$ being a square makes its conclusion about connectedness and simply-connectedness problematic. While the actual domain $D=\Set{(x,y,z)}{x>0,\ y>0,\ z>0}$ is indeed simply connected (and connected), the model's premise for $D$ is fundamentally wrong. It also only mentions simply connected, not connected.
3.  **Part (c) - Compute $\vnabla\times\vF$:** The model does not provide the curl of $\vF$.
4.  **Part (d) - Compute $\int_C \vF \cdot \dee{\vr}$:** The model does not compute the integral.
5.  **Part (e) - Is $\vF$ conservative?:** The model correctly states that $\vF$ is not conservative. However, it does not provide the necessary calculation (the curl from part c) to support this conclusion, which is generally expected in such a problem.

Overall, the model only provides a correct conclusion for part (e) without supporting work, and makes a fundamental error in defining the domain $D$ for parts (a) and (b). It completely omits answers for parts (c) and (d). ",False

Suppose that $\vG(\vx_0)\ne 0$. Pick a unit vector $\hn$ in the direction

**Answer:**

Faraday's law in integral form states that the circulation of the electric field around a closed loop is equal to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field flux through the loop. To deduce the differential form of this law, we can use the following steps:

1. Apply the definition of the curl operator to the left-hand side of the equation.
2. Use the vector identity for the curl of a product to expand the right-hand side.
3. Rearrange the resulting equation to obtain the desired form.

1.  **Step 1:** While implicitly related, simply stating ""Apply the definition of the curl operator to the left-hand side"" is vague. The correct and necessary step is explicitly applying **Stokes' Theorem**.
2.  **Step 2:** The model suggests ""Use the vector identity for the curl of a product to expand the right-hand side."" This is incorrect. The right-hand side involves a time derivative of a flux integral. The relevant step is moving the time derivative *inside* the integral, which requires justification (e.g., assuming the surface is fixed in time). There is no ""curl of a product"" identity involved here.
3.  **Crucial Omission:** The model completely omits the most important step after combining the integrals: explaining why the integrand must be zero if the integral is zero for any arbitrary surface $S$. This is typically argued using the Fundamental Lemma of Calculus of Variations or a proof by contradiction, as shown in the gold answer.

(a)
 Denote by $\theta$ the angle between $\Ha$ and $\vr$.
The point $\vr$ is a distance $\ell=|\vr|\,\sin\theta$ from the axis

$\ell$ centred on the axis of rotation.

In one second the point sweeps
out an arc of this circle that subtends an angle of $\Om$ radians. This arc
is the fraction $\frac{\Om}{2\pi}$ of a full circle and so has length
$\frac{\Om}{2\pi}2\pi \ell=\Om\ell=\Om|\vr|\,\sin\theta$. Thus the point
is moving with speed $\Om|\vr|\,\sin\theta$. The velocity vector of the
point must have length $\Om|\vr|\,\sin\theta$ and direction perpendicular
to both $\Ha$ and $\vr$. The vector 
$\vOm\times\vr$ is perpendicular to both  $\vr$ and $\vOm=\Om\Ha$
and has length
$\ 
|\vOm|\,|\vr|\,\sin\theta

**Solution:**

The given integrals are:

$$\int_0^{\pi/2}\cos^3x\ \sin^2x\,\dee{x}$$

$$\int_1^{e}x^3\log x\,\dee{x}$$

$$u = 9+x^2$$

$$du = x\dx$$

Evaluate $\displaystyle\int \sqrt{\frac{x}{1-x}}~\dee{x}$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
It's not immediately clear where to start, but a common method we've seen is to use the denominator in a $u$-substitution, especially when square roots are involved.

Let $u = \sqrt{1-x}$, $\dee{u} = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-x}}\dee{x}$. Then $u^2=1-x$, so $x = 1-u^2$.

\begin{align*}
\int \sqrt{\frac{x}{1-x}}~\dee{x}&=2\int \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2\sqrt{1-x}}~\dee{x} =- 2\int\sqrt{1-u^2}~\dee{u}

&=-\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)+C\\

\end{align*}
In ($*$), to convert from $\theta$ to $u$, our substitution $u=\sin\theta$ tells us $\theta = \arcsin u$. To find $\cos \theta$, we can either trace our work backwards to see that we already simplified $\sqrt{1-u^2}$ into $\cos\theta$, or we can draw a right triangle with angle $\theta$ and $\sin \theta=u$, then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side of the triangle and $\cos\theta$.

\item The polynomial $5x^3-3x^2-10x+6$ has a repeated pattern: the ratio of the first two coefficients is the same as the ratio of the last two coefficients. We can use this to factor.

\item Without seeing any obvious patterns, we start hunting for roots. Since we have all integer coefficients, if there are any integer roots, they will divide our constant term, $-6$. So, our candidates for roots are $\pm1,\,\pm2,\,\pm3,$ and $\pm6$. To save time, we don't need to know exactly the value of our polynomial at these points: only whether or not it is 0. Write $f(x) = x^4  - 4x^3 - 10x^2 - 11x - 6$.
\begin{align*}
\color{red}f(-1)&\color{red}=0&
f(-2)&\neq 0&

f(1)&\neq 0&
f(2)&\neq 0&
f(3)&\neq 0&
\color{red}f(6)&\color{red}= 0

Since $x=-1$ and $x=6$ are roots of our polynomial, it has factors $(x+1)$ and $(x-6)$. Note $(x+1)(x-6) = x^2-5x-6$. We use long division to figure out what else is lurking in our polynomial.
\begin{center}
 \polylongdiv{x^4-4x^3-10x^2-11x-6}{x^2-5x-6}\end{center}

 So, $x^4-4x^3-10x^2-11x-6 = (x+1)(x-6)(x^2+x+1)$.

 We should check whether $x^2+x+1$ is reducible or not. If we try to find its roots with the quadratic equation, we get $\dfrac{-1\pm\sqrt{-3}}{2}$, which are not real numbers. So, we're at the end of our factoring.

 \item Without seeing any obvious patterns, we start hunting for roots. Since we have all integer coefficients, if there are any integer roots, they will divide our constant term, $-15$. So, our candidates for roots are $\pm1,\,\pm3,\,\pm5,$ and $\pm15$.
Write $f(x) = 2x^4  + 12x^3 - x^2 - 52x + 15$.

f(-5)&\neq 0\\
f(1)&\neq 0&
f(3)&\neq 0&
f(5)&\neq 0&
f(15)&\neq 0&

Since $x=-3$ and $x=-5$ are roots of our polynomial, it has factors $(x+3)$ and $(x+5)$. Note $(x+3)(x+5) = x^2+8x+15$. We use long division to move forward.

\begin{center}
 \polylongdiv{2x^4+12x^3-x^2-52x+15}{x^2+8x+15}\end{center}

 So, $2x^4+12x^3-x^2-52x+15= (x+3)(x+5)(2x^2-4x+1)$.

 We should check whether $2x^2-4x+1$ is reducible or not. There's not an obvious way to factor it, but we can  use the quadratic equation. This gives us roots
 $\dfrac{4\pm\sqrt{16-8}}{4}=1\pm\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$. So, we have two more linear factors.

Specifically:  $2x^4+12x^3-x^2-52x+15= (x+3)(x+5)\left(x-\Big(1+\frac{\sqrt2}{2}\Big)\right)

So, $\frac{2}{x(x+1)}$ is the top function when $\frac{1}{4}\leq x < 1$, and
$\frac{4}{3+x^2}$ is the top function when $1<x \leq 3$. Then the area we want to find is:
\[\mbox{Area}=\int_{\frac14}^1 \left( \frac{2}{x(x+1)} - \frac{4}{3+x^2}\right)~\dee{x}+
\int_{1}^3 \left( \frac{4}{3+x^2} -\frac{2}{x(x+1)}  \right)~\dee{x} \]

We'll need to antidifferentiate both these functions. We can antidifferentiate $\dfrac{2}{x(x+1)}$ using partial fraction decomposition.

\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{x(x+1)}&=\frac{A}{x}+\frac{B}{x+1} = \frac{(A+B)x+A}{x(x+1)}\\
\color{red}A&\color{red}=2,\quad B=-2\\
\int\frac{2}{x(x+1)}~\dee{x}&=\int\left(\frac{2}{x}-\frac{2}{x+1}\right)~\dee{x}=2\log|x|-2\log|x+1|+C\\
&=2\log\left| \frac{x}{x+1}\right|+C
\end{align*}

We can antidifferentiate $\dfrac{4}{3+x^2}$ using the substitution $u=\frac{x}{\sqrt3}$, $\dee{u}=\frac{1}{\sqrt3}~\dee{x}$.
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{4}{3+x^2}~\dee{x}&=
\int\frac{4}{3\left(1+\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt3}\right)^2\right)}~\dee{x}=
\int\frac{4\sqrt3}{3\left(1+u^2\right)}~\dee{u}\\
&=\frac{4}{\sqrt3}\arctan u +C=\frac{4}{\sqrt3}\arctan \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt3}\right) +C
\end{align*}

Now, we can find our area.

**Solution:**

The area of the finite region bounded by the curves $y=\dfrac{4}{3+x^2}$, $y=\dfrac{2}{x(x+1)}$, $x=\dfrac14$, and $x=3$ can be found using the formula for the area between curves:

$$A=\int_a^b\int_c^dydx$$

**Solution:**

The derivative of $x\log(ax)$ is given by

$$\frac{d}{dx}(x\log(ax)) = \log(ax) + x\frac{1}{a} \frac{1}{x} = \log(ax) + 1$$

Therefore, the antiderivative of $x\log(ax)$ is

$$F(x) = x\log(ax) + x + C$$

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: $F(x) = x\log(ax"," The model incorrectly evaluates the derivative asked in the first part of the question. It calculates the derivative of $x\log(ax)$ as $\log(ax)+1$, but it fails to subtract the derivative of $x$ (which is $1$), so it does not simplify $\diff{}{x}\{x\log(ax)-x\}$ to $\log(ax)$ as required.

Consequently, its statement about the antiderivative is also incorrect and nonsensical. The question asks what antiderivative the *computed derivative* tells you. The model states ""the antiderivative of $x\log(ax)$ is $F(x) = x\log(ax) + x + C$"", which is not what the derivative implies nor is it an antiderivative of $x\log(ax)$.

First, let's identify all ``sources of impropriety."" The integrand has a singularity when $4x^2-x=0$, that is, when $x(4x-1)=0$, so at $x=0$ and $x=\frac{1}{4}$. Neither of these are in our domain of integration, so the only ``source of impropriety"" is the unbounded domain of integration.

We could antidifferentiate this function (it looks like a nice candidate for a trig substitution), but is seems easier to use a comparison. For large values of $x$, the term $x^2$ will be much larger than $x$, so we might guess that our integral behaves similarly to $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2}}~\dee{x}=\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{2x}~\dee{x}$.


For all $x\ge 1$, $\sqrt{4x^2-x}\le\sqrt{4x^2}=2x$. So, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}} \geq \frac{1}{2x}$. Note $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{2x}~\dee{x}$ diverges:

conver"," The model's final answer is incorrect. The improper integral $\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}}\,\dee{x}$ diverges, as correctly shown in the gold answer. The model incorrectly concludes that the integral converges.

Furthermore, the model's justification for convergence is flawed. While the inequality $\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}}\leq\frac{1}{x}$ is true for $x \ge 1$, the integral $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x}\,\dee{x}$ diverges. If an integral is less than or equal to a divergent integral, the comparison test yields no information about its convergence or divergence. For convergence, the comparison integral must converge. For divergence, the comparison integral must be less than or equal to the original integral, and itself diverge (as correctly done in the gold answer with $\frac{1}{2x}$). ",False

Let $M_{n,t}$ be the Midpoint Rule approximation for

Find a value of $t$ and a value of $n$ such that $M_{n,t}$ differs
from  $\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\ \dee{x}$ by at most $10^{-4}$.
Recall that the error $E_n$ introduced when the Midpoint

\begin{align*}
|E_n|\le \frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^2}
\end{align*}
where $M$ is the maximum absolute value of the second derivative of the
integrand and $a$ and $b$ are the end points of the interval of integration.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
There are two sources of error: the upper bound is $t$, rather than infinity, and we're using an approximation with some finite number of intervals, $n$. Our plan is to first find a value of $t$ that introduces an error of no more than $\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}$. That is, we'll find a value of $t$ such that $\int_t^\infty \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}~\dee{x} \leq \frac{1}{2}10^{-4}$. After that, we'll find a value of $n$ that approximates $\int_0^t \frac{e^{-x}}{x+1}~\dee{x}$ to within $\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}$. Then, all together, our  error will be at most $\frac{1}{2}10^{-4} + \frac{1}{2}10^{-4} = 10^{-4}$, as desired. (Note we could have broken up the error in another way---it didn't have to be $\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}$. This will give us one of many possible answers.)

Let's  find a $t$ such that
$\int_t^\infty  \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\ \dee{x}\le\frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}$.
For all $x\ge 0$,
$0<\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\le e^{-x}$, so
\begin{align*}
\int_t^\infty  \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\ \dee{x}
\le \int_t^\infty e^{-x}\ \dee{x}
=e^{-t}&\stackrel{(*)}{\le}\frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}\\
\hbox{where ($*$) is true if }\quad
t&\ge -\log\Big(\frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}\Big)\approx 9.90
\end{align*}
Choose, for example, $t=10$.

Now it's time to decide how many intervals we're going to use to approximate $\displaystyle\int_0^t \frac{e^{-x}}{x+1}~\dee{x}$. Again, we want our error to be less than $\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}$. To bound our error, we need to know the second derivative of $\frac{e^{-x}}{x+1}$.
\begin{align*}
f(x)=\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}
\implies f'(x)=-\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}-\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+x)^2}
\implies f''(x)&=\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}+2\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+x)^2}
+2\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+x)^3}
\end{align*}
Since $f''(x)$ is positive, and decreases as $x$ increases,
\begin{align*}
|f''(x)|\le f''(0) = 5
\implies |E_n|\le\frac{5(10-0)^3}{24n^2}=\frac{5000}{24n^2}
=\frac{625}{3n^2}
\end{align*}
and $|E_n|\le \frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}$ if
\begin{alignat*}{3}
&&\frac{625}{3n^2}&\le \frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}\\
&\iff\qquad &
n^2&\ge \frac{1250\times 10^4}{3}\\
&\iff\quad &n&\ge \sqrt{\frac{1.25\times 10^7}{3}}
\approx 2041.2
\end{alignat*}
So $t=10$ and $n= 2042$ will do the job.

**Solution:**

The given expression is a right Riemann sum. We know that the function $f(x)$ is given by the formula

The number of subintervals is $n = 10$, and the width of each subinterval is

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Since $f(x)$ is linear, there exist real numbers $m$ and $c$ such that $f(x)=mx+c$. Now we can do some calculations. Suppose we have a rectangle in our Riemann sum that takes up the interval $[x,x+w]$.
\begin{itemize}
\color{blue} \item If we are using a left Riemann sum, our rectangle has height $f(x)=mx+c$.
Then it has area $w(mx+c)$. \color{red}
\item If we are using a right Riemann sum, our rectangle has height $f(x+w)=m(x+w)+c=mx+c+mw$. Then it has area $w(mx+c+mw)$.\color{black}
\item If we are using a midpoint Riemann sum, our rectangle has height $f(x+\frac{1}{2}w)=m(x+\frac{1}{2}w)+c=mx+c+\frac{1}{2}mw$.   Then it has area $w\left(mx+c+\frac{1}{2}w\right)$.

So, for each rectangle in our sums, the midpoint rectangle  has the same area as the average of the left and right rectangles:
\[w\left(mx+c+\frac{1}{2}mw\right) = \dfrac{\textcolor{blue}{w(mx+c)}+\textcolor{red}{w(mx+c+mw)}}{2}\]
It follows that the midpoint Riemann sum has a value equal to the average of the values of the left and right Riemann sums. To see this, let the rectangles in the midpoint Riemann sum have areas $M_1,M_2,\ldots,M_n$,
let the rectangles in the left Riemann sum have areas $\textcolor{blue}{L_1,L_2,\ldots,L_n}$, and
let the rectangles in the right Riemann sum have areas $\textcolor{red}{R_1,R_2,\ldots,R_n}$. Then the midpoint Riemann sum evaluates to $M_1+M_2+\cdots+M_n$, and:

\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The left and right Riemann sums approximate the area under the curve of $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ using the sum of the areas of rectangles. The midpoint Riemann sum approximates the area under the curve of $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ using the sum of the areas of rectangles with midpoints on the curve. If we average the left and right Riemann sums, we are essentially taking the average of the two approximations, which will be closer to the actual area under the curve than either approximation alone. Therefore, the statement is true.

**Final Answer:**"," The model's reasoning is insufficient and does not provide a mathematical justification for the claim. While the statement is indeed true for linear functions, the model merely states general properties of Riemann sums (e.g., averaging makes approximations closer to the actual area) without explaining *why* the average of the left and right Riemann sums equals the midpoint Riemann sum specifically for a linear function. A proper explanation would involve showing that for a linear function $f(x)$, the value $f(\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2})$ is equal to $\frac{f(x_i)+f(x_{i+1})}{2}$, which is the core property that makes the statement true.

Show that there exists at least one real number $c$ such that $2\tan(c)=c+1$.

We let $f(x)=2\tan(x)-x-1$. Then $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the interval $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ since $\tan(x)=\sin(x)/\cos(x)$ is continuous on this interval, while $x+1$ is a polynomial and therefore continuous for all real numbers.

We find a value $a\in (-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ such that $f(a)<0$. We observe immediately that $a=0$ works since
$$f(0)=2\tan(0)-0-1=0-1=-1<0.$$

We find a value $b\in (-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ such that $f(b)>0$. We see that $b=\pi/4$ works since
$$f(\pi/4)=2\tan(\pi/4) -\pi/4 - 1=2-\pi/4 - 1=1-\pi/4=(4-\pi)/4>0,$$
because $3<\pi<4$.

**Answer:**

The region $D$ is bounded by the parabola $y^2 = x$ and the line $y = x - 2$. This means that the boundary of $D$ is given by the equations $y = \sqrt{x}$, $y = x - 2$, and $x = 0$.

**Answer:**

The solid is bounded by the surfaces $z=e^{-x^2-y^2}$, $z=0$, and $x^2+y^2=4$. Therefore, the limits of integration for the triple integral are:

$$\int_0^2 \int_0^{\sqrt{4-x^2}} \int_0^{e^{-x^2-y^2}} dz dy dx$$

To calculate the volume, we evaluate this integral:

$$\int_0^2 \int_0^{\sqrt{4-x^2}} \int_0","
The model's setup for part (a) is incorrect. The given integral $\int_0^2 \int_0^{\sqrt{4-x^2}} \int_0^{e^{-x^2-y^2}} dz dy dx$ only covers the volume over the first quadrant of the disk $x^2+y^2 \le 4$. The solid is bounded by $x^2+y^2=4$, which means the integration for $x$ should be from $-2$ to $2$, and for $y$ it should be from $-\sqrt{4-x^2}$ to $\sqrt{4-x^2}$, as shown in the gold answer.

We'll use polar coordinates. In $D$
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\theta$ runs from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and
\item
for each fixed $\theta$ between $0$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $r$ runs from
$1$ to $1+\cos(\theta)$.
\end{itemize}
So the area of $D$ is 
\begin{equation*}
\text{area}=A=\int_0^{\pi/2} \dee{\theta}\int_1^{1+\cos\theta} \dee{r}\ r

\text{ave\ dist}&=\frac{1}{A}\int_0^{\pi/2} \dee{\theta}\int_1^{1+\cos\theta} 
                                    \dee{r}\ r^2

Now we evaluate the integrals of the various powers of cosine.
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\pi/2}\cos\theta\ \dee{\theta}&=\sin\theta\,\bigg|_0^{\pi/2}=1 \\
\int_0^{\pi/2}\cos^2\theta\ \dee{\theta}&=\frac{\cos\theta\sin\theta}{2}\,\bigg|_0^{\pi/2}

$$\bar{d}=\frac{1}{A(D)}\int_D d(x,y)dxdy$$

Write the integral given below $5$ other ways, each with a different 
order of integration.

**Solution:**

The given integral can be rewritten in three other ways, each with a different order of integration.

**1. Order of integration: dy dx dz**

$$\int_0^1 \int_{\sqrt{x}}^1 \int_0^{1-y} f(x,y,z)\,\dee{z}\,\dee{y}\,\dee{x}= \int_0^1 \int_0^{1-y} \int_0^{\sqrt{x}} f(x,y,z)\,\dee{z} \ dx \ dy$$

**2. Order"," The problem asks for 5 other ways to write the given integral. The model states that the integral can be rewritten in ""three other ways"" which is incorrect, as there are 5 other permutations for a total of 6 ways. The model only provides one attempted alternative integral and then stops. The one integral provided by the model is also incorrect:

Original integral's region of integration:
$0 \le x \le 1$
$\sqrt{x} \le y \le 1$
$0 \le z \le 1-y$

The model provides the following integral:
$\int_0^1 \int_0^{1-y} \int_0^{\sqrt{x}} f(x,y,z)\,\dee{z} \ dx \ dy$

Let's analyze the region defined by the model's integral:
$0 \le y \le 1$
$0 \le x \le 1-y$
$0 \le z \le \sqrt{x}$

Comparing these bounds to the original region:
1. The bounds for the inner integral `dz`: The original integral has $0 \le z \le 1-y$. The model has $0 \le z \le \sqrt{x}$. These are different and define a different region.
2. The bounds for the middle integral `dx`: For the order `dz dx dy` (which is what the model writes, though it states `dy dx dz`), the bounds for `x` should be $0 \le x \le y^2$. The model has $0 \le x \le 1-y$. This is also incorrect.

The model fails to provide the required number of alternative integrals and the single attempt it provides is mathematically incorrect. ",False

**Solution:**

The region $E$ is defined by the inequalities:

$$0 \leq y \leq \sqrt{x}$$

Therefore, the volume of $E$ is given by the integral:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Find the mass of the shell.

\item
Find the location of the center of mass of the shell.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Let's use $H$ to denote the hemispherical shell.
On that shell, the spherical coordinate $\varphi$ runs from $0$
(on the $z$--axis) to $\pi/2$ (on the $xy$--plane, $z=0$)
and the spherical coordinate $\rho$ runs from $2$, on $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$,
to $3$, on $x^2+y^2+z^2=9$. So, in spherical coordinates,
\begin{align*}
H=\Set{
(\rho\sin\varphi\cos\theta\,,\,\rho\sin\varphi\sin\theta\,,\,\rho\cos\varphi)}{2\le \rho\le 3,\ 0\le\varphi\le\pi/2,\ 0\le\theta\le 2\pi}
\end{align*}

(a) In spherical coordinates 
$\dee{V}=\rho^2\sin\varphi\ \dee{\rho}\,\dee{\varphi}\,\dee{\theta}$,
so that, as the density is the constant $D$,
\begin{align*}
\text{Mass}(H)
&=\int_2^3\dee{\rho} \int_0^{2\pi}\dee{\theta}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\varphi}\ 
           D\ \rho^2\sin\varphi \\
&=D\ \left[\int_2^3\dee{\rho}\ \rho^2\right]\ 
     \left[\int_0^{2\pi}\dee{\theta}\right]\ 
     \left[\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi\right] \\
&= D\left[\frac{3^3}{3}-\frac{2^3}{3}\right]\ 
     \big[2\pi\big]\ \big[\cos 0 -\cos(\pi/2)\big] \\
&=\frac{38}{3}\pi D
\end{align*}

\goodbreak
We could have gotten the same result by expressing the mass as
\begin{itemize}
\item
one half, times
\item
the density $D$, times
\item
the difference between 
the volume of a sphere of radius $3$ and a sphere of radius $2$.
\end{itemize}
That is
\begin{align*}
\text{Mass}(H) =\frac{1}{2}D\left[\frac{4}{3}\pi 3^3-\frac{4}{3}\pi 2^3\right]
               =\frac{38}{3}\pi D
\end{align*}

(b) By definition, the centre of mass is $(\bar x,\bar y,\bar z)$
where $\bar x$, $\bar y$ and $\bar z$ are the weighted averages of
$x$, $y$ and $z$, respectively, over $H$. That is
\begin{align*}
\bar x =\frac{\tripInt_H x\,D\,\dee{V}}{\tripInt_H D\,\dee{V}}\qquad
\bar y =\frac{\tripInt_H y\,D\,\dee{V}}{\tripInt_H D\,\dee{V}}\qquad
\bar z =\frac{\tripInt_H z\,D\,\dee{V}}{\tripInt_H D\,\dee{V}}
\end{align*}
As $H$ is invariant under reflection in the $yz$--plane (i.e. under
$x\rightarrow-x$) we have $\bar x=0$.
As $H$ is also invariant under reflection in the $xz$--plane (i.e. under
$y\rightarrow-y$) we have $\bar y=0$.
So we just have to find $\bar z$. We have already found the denominator in part 
(a), so we just have evaluate the numerator
\begin{align*}
\tripInt_H z\,D\,\dee{V}
&=\int_2^3\dee{\rho} \int_0^{2\pi}\dee{\theta}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\varphi}\ 
           D\ \rho^2\sin\varphi\ \overbrace{\rho\cos\varphi}^{z} \\
&=D\ \left[\int_2^3\dee{\rho}\ \rho^3\right]\ 
     \left[\int_0^{2\pi}\dee{\theta}\right]\ 
     \left[\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi\ \cos\varphi\right] \\
&= D\left[\frac{3^4}{4}-\frac{2^4}{4}\right]\ 
     \big[2\pi\big]\ 
     \left[\frac{1}{2}\sin^2\frac{\pi}{2} -\frac{1}{2}\sin^2 0\right] \\
&=\frac{81-16}{4}\pi D
=\frac{65}{4}\pi D

All together

\bar z =\frac{\frac{65}{4}\pi D}{\frac{38}{3}\pi D}

Crucially, the volume element used is `D r sin(theta) dr d(theta) d(phi)`, which is incorrect; it should be `D r^2 sin(theta) dr d(theta) d(phi)` (assuming `r` is `rho` and `theta` is `phi` in standard spherical coordinates, and given the Jacobian `rho^2 sin(phi)`).

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$$

"," The model's answer is incorrect for several reasons:
1.  **Violation of Instructions:** The question explicitly states, ""Do not evaluate any derivatives in answering this question."" The model proceeds to calculate the partial derivative $z_x = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$, directly violating this instruction.
2.  **Incorrect Premise:** The statement ""The high and low points of the surface occur when the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are equal to 0"" is incomplete and misleading. While critical points (where derivatives are zero) are candidates for extrema, extrema can also occur where derivatives do not exist (like the cone's apex) or on the boundary of the domain, which is relevant here.
3.  **Incomplete Solution:** The model stops after calculating $z_x$ and does not provide the high and low points or discuss the values of $z_x, z_y$ at those points, as requested by the question. It fails to reach a final answer. ",False

Let the function

Classify as $\big[$local maxima, minima or saddle points$\big]$
all critical points of $f(x,y)$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
To find the critical points we will need the
gradient of $f$, and to apply the second derivative test of 
Theorem \eref{CLP200}{thm second deriv test} in the CLP-3 text 
we will need all 
second order partial derivatives. So we need all partial derivatives of
$f$ up to order two.
Here they are.
\begin{alignat*}{3}
f&=x^3+3xy+3y^2-6x-3y-6 \hidewidth\\
f_x&=3x^2+3y-6   & f_{xx}&=6x \qquad & f_{xy}&= 3\\
f_y&=3x+6y-3 \qquad & f_{yy}&=6\qquad & f_{yx}&= 3
\end{alignat*}
(Of course, $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ have to be the same. It is still
useful to compute both, as a way to catch some mechanical errors.)

The critical points are the solutions of
\begin{alignat*}{3}
f_x&=3x^2+3y-6&&=0  \tag{E1} \\
f_y&=3x\ +6y-3 &&= 0  \tag{E2}
\end{alignat*}
Subtracting equation (E2) from twice equation (E1) gives
\begin{align*}
6x^2-3x-9=0
\iff (2x-3)(3x+3)=0
\end{align*}
So we must have either $x=\frac{3}{2}$ or $x=-1$.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
If $x=\frac{3}{2}$, (E2) reduces to $\frac{9}{2}+6y-3=0$ so $y=-\frac{1}{4}$.
\item 
If $x=-1$, (E2) reduces to $-3+6y-3=0$ so $y=1$.
\end{itemize}
So there are two critical points: $\big(\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{4}\big)$ and
$(-1,1)$.

**Solution:**

The partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ are

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y - 6$$

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 6y + 3x - 3$$

Setting these equal to 0 and solving for $x$ and $y$, we find the critical points are

$$\left(x_1, y_1\right) = \left(-2, 2\right)$$

$$\left(x_2, y_2\right) = \"," The model correctly calculates the first partial derivatives. However, the critical point $(x_1, y_1) = (-2, 2)$ identified by the model is incorrect.

The model failed to find the correct critical points, which are $(\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{4})$ and $(-1, 1)$.

(b)
There are no critical points in the interior of the allowed region,
so both the maximum and the minimum occur only on the boundary. The boundary
consists of the line segments (i) $x=1$, $0\le y\le 1$, (ii) $y=1$, $0\le
x\le 1$ and (iii) $y=1-x$, $0\le x\le 1$.

\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
First, we look at the part of the boundary with $x=1$. There $f=y^2-2y+2$.
As $\diff{}{y}(y^2-2y+2)=2y-2$ vanishes only at $y=1$, 
the max and min of $y^2-2y+2$ for $0\le y\le 1$ must occur either at $y=0$, 
where $f=2$, or at $y=1$, where $f=1$.

\item
Next, we look at the part of the boundary with $y=1$. There $f=2x^3-6x+5$.
As $\diff{}{x}(2x^3-6x+5)=6x^2-6$, 
the max and min of $2x^3-6x+5$ for $0\le x\le 1$ must occur either at $x=0$, 
where $f=5$, or at $x=1$, where $f=1$.

\item
Next, we look at the part of the boundary with $y=1-x$. There $f=2x^3-6x(1-x)
+(1-x)^2+4(1-x)=2x^3+7x^2-12x+5$.
As $\diff{}{x}(2x^3+7x^2-12x+5)=6x^2+14x-12
                               =2\big(3x^2+7x-6\big)
                               =2(3x-2)(x+3)$, 
the max and min of $2x^3+7x^2-12x+5$ for $0\le x\le 1$ must occur either at $x=0$,

**Solution:**

The partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ are

Setting these equal to 0 and solving for $x$ and $y$, we find the critical points are

To do this, we need to check if the limit of each variable separately is equal to the limit of the function with respect to both variables. If the limit of each variable separately is equal to the limit of the function with respect to both variables, then the limit of the function with respect to both variables exists and is equal to the limit of each variable separately.

The specific gravity $S$ of an object is given by $\ S=\frac{A}{A-W}\ $

\end{question} </Question>

**Solution:**

The specific gravity $S$ is given by the formula $S=\frac{A}{A-W}$. We have measurements for $A$ and $W$, so we can use these measurements to calculate an approximate value for $S$.

To find the approximate percentage error in calculating $S$, we first need to calculate the calculated value of $S$. We can do this by substituting the values of $A$ and $W$ into the formula for $S$.

**SOLUTION:**

The given surface is defined by the equation:

$$x^4+y^4+z^4+xyz=17$$

We can find the partial derivatives of $F(x,y,z)=x^4+y^4+z^4+xyz-17$ with respect to $y$ and $z$ as:

$$F_z=4z^3+xz$$

$$F_y=4","
The model's approach to finding $F_y$ and $F_z$ is incorrect. It directly calculates partial derivatives of the given surface equation as if $x,y,z$ are independent variables, which is not the case since $x=F(y,z)$. The correct method involves implicit differentiation.

Specifically, if $G(x,y,z) = x^4+y^4+z^4+xyz-17=0$, and $x=F(y,z)$, then $F_y = -\frac{G_y}{G_x}$ and $F_z = -\frac{G_z}{G_x}$.
The model states $F_y=4y^3+yz$, which is incorrect (it should be $4y^3+xz$ if it were $G_y$). Even if it were correctly written as $G_y=4y^3+xz$, it still needs to be divided by $G_x=4x^3+yz$ with a negative sign.

Let $F$ be a function on $\bbbr^2$. Denote points in $\bbbr^2$ by $(u, v)$

$F_v (u, v)$, $F_{uu}(u, v)$, $F_{uv}(u, v)$, etc..

**Solution:**

The partial derivative of a function $F$ with respect to $x$ is defined as

The given equations define $x$ and $y$ implicitly as functions of $u$ and $v$. To find the partial derivatives of $x$ and $y$ with respect to $u$, we need to use the implicit differentiation formula:

$$\pdiff{x}{u}=\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}=\frac{-(\partial y/\partial u)\cos(uv)}{1+(\partial y/\partial u)\sin(uv)}$$

$$\pdiff{y}{u}=\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}=\frac{\cos(uv)}{1+(\partial y/\"," The model's approach to implicit differentiation is incorrect and it does not complete the calculation. The formulas it provides for $\pdiff{x}{u}$ and $\pdiff{y}{u}$ are not derived from the given system of equations. The solution attempt is also incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence.

\begin{itemize}
\item
The tangent vector to $C$ at $\vr_0$ is

\pdiff{G}{z}\big( x_0\,,\,y_0\,,\,z_0\big)\rgt$ to $S$ at $\vr_0$ are 
perpendicular to each other. To do so, we observe that,
for every $t$, the point $\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big)$
lies on the surface $G(x,y,z)=0$ and so obeys
\begin{align*}
G\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big) =0

Differentiating this equation with respect to $t$ gives,
by the chain rule,
\begin{align*}
0&= \diff{}{t}G\big(x(t),y(t),z(t)\big) \\

by $(E_3)$. That is, $(x,y,z)$ obeys the equation, $(E_2)$, of the tangent plane to $S$ at $\vr_0$ and so is on that tangent plane.  So the tangent

The distance from the point $(x,y,z)$ to the origin $(0,0,0)$ is 
\begin{equation*}
r(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}

for all $(x,y,z)\ne  (0,0,0)$.

**Solution:**

The distance from a point $(x,y,z)$ to the origin is given by the formula

$$r(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$$

Laplace's equation is given by

$$u_{xx}+u_{yy}+u_{zz}=0$$

where $u(x,y,z)$ is the function to be found.

Using the formula for the distance, we can write

$$u(x,y,z) = r(x,y,z)^n = \sqrt", The model's answer is incomplete and does not provide a final answer for the values of 'n'. It cuts off mid-sentence. The gold answer correctly identifies $n=0$ and $n=-1$. ,False

**Solution:**

The PDE equation reads as

for some real number $\la$. By equation (E3), $2z(1-\la)=0$, which is
obeyed if and only if at least one of $z=0$, $\la=1$ is obeyed.

Substituting $x=\frac{2}{1-\la}$, from (E1), and

\begin{align*}
\frac{4}{(1-\la)^2} + \frac{1}{(1-\la)^2} =1

$\la$ cannot be zero because if it is, (1) forces $x=0$ and (2) forces

$$d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Since $w_1$ has the highest frequency, $w_2$ has the next-highest frequency, and so on, we know $f_1$ is larger than the other members of its sequence, $f_2$ is the next largest, etc. So, $\{f_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence.
		\item The most-used word in a language is $w_1$, while the $n$-th most used word in a language is $w_n$. So, we re-state the law as:
		\[f_1=nf_n\] Then we can rewrite this fomula a little more naturally as $f_n=\frac{1}{n}f_1$.
		\item Then $f_3=\frac{1}{3}f_1$. In this case, we expect the third-most used word to account for  $\frac{1}{3}(6\%) = 2\%$ of all words.
		\item From (b), we know $f_{10}=\frac{1}{10}f_1$. Note $f_1=6f_6=6(0.3\%)$. Then:
		\[f_{10}=\frac{1}{10}f_1 = \frac{1}{10}6f_6=\frac{1}{10}(6)(0.3\%)=\frac{1.8}{10}\%=0.18\%\]
		So, $f_{10}$ should be 0.18\% of all words.
		\item The use of the word ``frequency"" in the statement of Zipf's law implies $f_n = \frac{\text{uses of $w_n$}}{\text{total number of words}}$. The question asks for the total uses of $w_n$. If we call this quantity $t_n$, and the total number of all words is $T$, then Zipf's law tells us $\frac{t_n}{T}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{t_1}{T}$, hence $t_n=\frac{1}{n}t_1$.

		With this notation, the problem states $t_1=22,038,615$, $w_1=\texttt{the}$, $w_2=\texttt{be}$, and  $w_3=\texttt{and}$.

		Following Zipf's law, $t_n=\frac1nt_1$. So, we expect $t_2=\frac{t_1}{2} = 11,019,307.5$; since this isn't an integer, let's say we expect $t_2\approx 11,019,308$. Similarly, we expect
		$t_3=\frac{t_1}{3} = 7,346,205$.

		Remark: The 450-million-word source material that used ``the"" 22,038,615 times also contained 12,545,825 instances of ``be,"" and 10,741,073 instances of ``and."" While Zipf's Law might be a nice model for our data overall, in these few instances it does not appear to be extremely accurate.

	%	$f_3=\frac{f_1}{3+2.7}\approx 3,866,424$. Both Zipf and Mandelbrot predict frequencies of ``be"" and ``and"" that are smaller than the actual usage in our sample, but Mandelbrot's prediction is \emph{even smaller than} Zipf's. So, we might reasonably say that Zipf's law fits better in this case.

**Solution:**

The function 

$$f(x)=x^2 e^{-x^2}$$

is continuous and positive on the interval [0,1/2]. Therefore, the integral 

$$I=\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^2 e^{-x^2}\ \dee{x}$$

converges by the exponential decay theorem. 

Using the formula for the integral of $x^2 e^{-x^2}$,

$$I=\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2}\left(x^2+2\sqrt{\pi} \"," The model's approach to solving the problem is fundamentally incorrect. It attempts to find a closed-form antiderivative for $x^2 e^{-x^2}$, which is not an elementary function and is generally expressed in terms of special functions (like the error function). The provided formula for the integral is incorrect. The problem requires finding an interval using numerical approximation methods, such as Taylor series expansion (as demonstrated in the gold answer) or numerical integration, to meet the specified precision requirement.

Substituting $x=-t$ into the known power series

we see that:
\begin{align*}

	(That is, an absolute error less than $5\times10^{-11}$.)

	You may assume without proof that $2<e<3$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
	We'll use  Theorem~\eref{CLP101}{eq:TaylorPolyPlusError_b} in the CLP-2 text to bound the error of a partial-sum approximation. The error in the partial-sum approximation $S_N$ is
	\[E_N=\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}\]
	for some $c$ strictly between $a$ and $x$. In our case, $a=0$ and $x$ is in $(-2,1)$. So, we want to find a value of $N$ such that
	\[\left|\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}\left(x\right)^{N+1}\right|<5\times 10^{-11}\]
	for \emph{all} $x$ in $(-2,1)$, and \emph{all} $c$ in $(-2,1)$.

	To find this $N$, we to know $f^{(N+1)}(x)$. Just like when we create a Taylor polynomial from scratch, we'll differentiate $f(x)$ several times, and look for a pattern.

\begin{align*}
f(x)=\sinh(x)&=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\
f'(x)&=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}\\
f''(x)&=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\
f'''(x)&=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}
\end{align*}
That is, even derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f(x)$, and odd derivatives of $f(x)$ are $\frac{{e^x}+e^{-x}}{2}$ (which, incidentally, is the function called $\cosh x$).

	Now we want a reasonable bound on $f^{(N+1)}(c)$, when $c$ is in $(-2,1)$. Since powers of $e$ are always positive, we begin by noting that $0<\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}<\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$. So, all derivatives of $f(x)$ are bounded above by $\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$.
	\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&&-2 &<c<1\\
	&\Rightarrow&\qquad e^{-2} &<e^c<e &\mbox{and } e^{-1}&<e^{-c}<e^2\\
	&\Rightarrow&\qquad f^{(N+1)}(c)&<\frac{e^c+e^{-c}}{2} & &<\frac{e^2+e^2}{2}=e^2<9
	\end{alignat*}

	This bound provides us with a ``worst-case scenario"" error. We don't know exactly what $c$ is, but we don't need to--the bound above holds for \emph{all} $c$ between $-2$ and $1$.

	We also don't know exactly what $x$ will be, only that it's between $-2$ and $1$. So, we note $|x|^{N+1}<2^{N+1}$.

	Now we're ready to choose an $N$ that results in a sufficiently small error bound.

	\begin{align*}
	\left|\frac{\textcolor{blue}{f^{(N+1)}(c)}}{(N+1)!}\textcolor{red}{\left(x\right)^{N+1}}\right|&<
	\frac{\textcolor{blue}{9}\cdot \textcolor{red}{2^{N+1}}}{(N+1)!}\\
	\text{So, we want:}\qquad \frac{9\cdot2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}&<5\times 10^{-11}
	\end{align*}

	To find an appropriate $N$, we test several values.

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			\hline
			$N$&$ \dfrac{9\cdot 2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}$\\ \hline
			10 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{11}}{(11)!}\approx 5\times 10^{-4}$\\\hline
			15 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{16}}{(16)!}\approx 3\times 10^{-8}$\\\hline
			17 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{18}}{(18)!}\approx 4\times 10^{-10}$\\\hline
			18 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{19}}{(19)!}\approx 4\times 10^{-11}<5\times10^{-11}$\\\hline

\end{question}","\begin{solution}

	Our plan is as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Make a Taylor series for $f(x)$
	\item Calculate the tenth derivative of the Taylor series of $f(x)$.
	\item Decide how many terms we need to add to achieve the desired accuracy.
	\item Approximate $f^{(10)}\left(\frac15\right)$ with a partial sum.
	\end{itemize}

We know that the Taylor series for $\arctan x$ is $\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$, which converges for $-1\le x\le1$. So, the Taylor series for $\arctan(x^3)$ is
\[f(x)=\arctan(x^3)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(x^3)^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^{6n+3}}{2n+1}\]
It is much easier to differentiate this series many times than it is to differentiate $\arctan(x^3)$ directly many times.
\begin{align*}
f'(x)&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(6n+3)x^{6n+2}}{2n+1}\\
f''(x)&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(6n+3)(6n+2)x^{6n+1}}{2n+1}\\

&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(6n+3)!}{(2n+1)(6n-7)!}x^{6n-7}\\
f^{(10)}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(6n+3)!}{(2n+1)(6n-7)!\cdot 5^{6n-7}}
\end{align*}
(Notice, after ten differentiations, the terms $a_0$ and $a_1$ are both zero.)

Since this is an alternating series, the absolute error involved in using the approximation $S_N$ is at most
\[|a_{N+1}|=\frac{(6N+9)!}{(2N+3)(6N-1)!\cdot 5^{6N-1}}\]
By testing a few values of $N$, we find
\[|a_6|=|a_{5+1}|=\frac{39!}{(13)(29!)\cdot 5^{29}}\approx 0.00000095<10^{-6}\]
So, $S_5$ is a sufficient approximation. That is,
\begin{align*}
f^{(10)}\left(\frac15\right)&\approx \sum_{n=2}^5 (-1)^n\frac{(6n+3)!}{(2n+1)(6n-7)!\cdot 5^{6n-7}}\\

**Solution:**

The Maclaurin series for arctangent is given by

$$f(x)= \tan^{-1}(x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} x^{2n+1}$$

The derivative of $f(x)$ is

\begin{description}
\item[Solution 1:]
We need to show that
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges.
If we replace $n$ by $x$ in the summand, we get $f(x) = 24x^2 e^{-x^3}$,
which we can integate. (Just substitute $u=x^3$.)
So let's try the integral test.
First, we have to check that $f(x)$ is positive and decreasing.
It is certainly positive. To determine if it is decreasing, we compute
\begin{align*}
\diff{f}{x} = 48x e^{-x^3} - 24\times 3 x^4 e^{-x^3}
= 24x (2-3x^3) e^{-x^3}
\end{align*}
which is negative for $x\ge1$. Therefore $f(x)$ is decreasing for $x\ge1$,
and the integral test applies. The substitution $u=x^3$,
$\dee{u}=3x^2\,\,\dee{x}$, yields
\begin{align*}
\int f(x) \,\dee{x}
= \int 24x^2 e^{-x^3} \,\dee{x} = \int 8 e^{-u}\,\dee{u} = -8e^{-u} + C = -8e^{-x^3} + C.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\int_1^\infty f(x) \,\dee{x} &= \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_1^R f(x) \,\dee{x}
  = \lim_{R \to \infty} \bigg[{-}8 e^{-x^3} \bigg]_1^R  \\
   &= \lim_{R \to \infty} ( - 8 e^{-R^3} + 8 e^{-1}  ) = 8 e^{-1}
\end{align*}
Since the integral is convergent, the series
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges
and the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$
converges absolutely.

\item[Solution 2:]
Alternatively, we can use the ratio test with $a_n=24n^2 e^{-n^3}$.
We calculate
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{24 (n+1)^2e^{-(n+1)^3}}{24 n^2e^{-n^3}} \right| \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( \frac{(n+1)^2}{n^2} \frac{e^{n^3}}{e^{(n+1)^3}} \right) \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 e^{-(3n^2+3n+1)} = 1\cdot0=0 < 1,
\end{align*}
and therefore the series converges absolutely.

\item[Solution 3:]
Alternatively, alternatively, we can use the limiting comparison test.
First a little intuition building. Recall that we need to show that
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges. The $n^{\rm th}$
term in this series is
\begin{equation*}
a_n = 24n^2 e^{-n^3} =\frac{24 n^2}{e^{n^3}}
\end{equation*}
It is a ratio with both the numerator and denominator growing with $n$.
A good rule of thumb is that exponentials grow a lot faster than powers.
For example, if $n=10$ the numerator is $2400=2.4\times 10^3$
and the denominator is about $2\times 10^{434}$.
So we would guess that $a_n$ tends to zero as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
The question is ``does $a_n$ tend to zero fast enough with $n$ that our series converges?''. For example, we know that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$
converges (by the $p$--test with $p=2$). So if $a_n$ tends to zero faster
than $\frac{1}{n^2}$ does, our series will converge. So let's try the limiting convergence test with $a_n = 24n^2 e^{-n^3} =\frac{24 n^2}{e^{n^3}}$
and $b_n=\frac{1}{n^2}$.
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{24n^2 e^{-n^3}}{1/n^2}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{24n^4 }{e^{n^3}}
\end{align*}
By l'H\^opital's rule, twice,
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{24x^4 }{e^{x^3}}
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{4\times 24x^3 }{3 x^2e^{x^3}}
&\text{by l'H\^opital} \\
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{32x }{e^{x^3}}
&\text{just cleaning up} \\
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{32 }{3x^2e^{x^3}}
&\text{by l'H\^opital, again} \\
&=0
\end{align*}
That's it. The limit comparison test now tells us that
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges.

\end{description}

\noindent (b)
In part (a) we saw that $24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ is positive and decreasing.
The limit of this sequence equals $0$ (as can be shown with l'H\^opital's
Rule, just as we did at the end of the third solution of part (a)). Therefore, we can
use the alternating series test, so that the
error made in approximating the infinite sum
$S= \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_n
= \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty  (-1)^{n-1} 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ by the sum of its first $N$ terms,
$S_N=\sum\limits_{n=1}^N a_n$,  lies between $0$
and the first omitted term, $a_{N+1}$.
If we use $5$ terms, the error satisfies
\begin{align*}
   |S - S_5 | \le |a_6| = 24 \times 36 e^{-6^3}\approx 1.3 \times 10^{-91}

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty |(-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}| = \sum_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$$

The model's answer for part (a) incorrectly states that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges by the Alternating Series Test.

While the series does converge (as shown by the Integral Test, Ratio Test, or Limit Comparison Test in the gold solution), the justification provided by the model is incorrect.

$F(x,y) = \sqrt{1+f_x(x,y)^2+f_y(x,y)^2}$.

(b)  (i) The ``dimple'' to be painted is part of the upper sphere
$x^2+y^2+\big(z-2\sqrt{3}\big)^2=4$. It is on the bottom half of the sphere
and so has equation $z=f(x,y)=2\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}$. Note that
\begin{align*}
f_x(x,y) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}}\qquad
f_y(x,y) = \frac{y}{\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}}
\end{align*}
The point on the dimple with the largest value of $x$ is
$(1,0,\sqrt{3})$. (It is marked by a dot in the figure above.) The dimple
is invariant under rotations around the $z$--axis and so has $(x,y)$
running over $x^2+y^2\le 1$. So, by 
(\eref{CLP317}{eq:SUdSgraph}) in the CLP-4 text,
\begin{align*}
\text{Surface area}

&= \dblInt_{x^2+y^2\le 1}\frac{2}{\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}}\ \dee{x}\,\dee{y}

\text{Surface area}
&= \int_0^{2\pi}\dee{\theta}\int_0^1\dee{r}\ \frac{2r}{\sqrt{4-r^2}}

in the plane $z=\sqrt{3}$, as in the figure below, the ``Death Star'' 
becomes a perfect ball of radius $2$.  
\begin{center}

The area of the pink dimple in the figure above is identical to the area

**Solution:**

The direction field of a vector field \vv(x,y) is a graphical representation that shows the direction of the flow of the vector field at each point in the domain. To sketch the direction field of \vv(x,y)=(x^2+xy,y^2-xy), we first find the partial derivatives of \vv with respect to x and y.

The partial derivatives are:

$$\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}=2x+y$$

$$\frac{\partial v_2}{\partial y}=2y-x$$

Using these partial derivatives,"," The model's approach is fundamentally incorrect for sketching a direction field. It calculates partial derivatives of the components of the vector field, which is not the standard or relevant method for sketching a direction field. A direction field is sketched by evaluating the vector at various points and drawing short line segments or arrows in the direction of the vector at those points, or by analyzing regions where the components have specific signs.

**Solution:**

The screening test for conservative vector fields checks if the vector field is curl-free. If the curl of the vector field is zero, then the vector field is conservative.

For each of the given vector fields, we compute the curl. If the curl is zero, then the vector field is conservative. The final answers are:

**Final Answer:**

1. $\vF=x\hi + z\hj + y\hk$ is conservative.
2. $\vF=y^2z\hi + x^2z\hj + x^2y\hk$ is not","
The model's fundamental understanding of the ""screening test for conservative vector fields"" is incorrect given the provided options A, B, and C, and the Gold Answer's interpretation.

The model states: ""If the curl of the vector field is zero, then the vector field is conservative."" This implies that if the curl is zero, the screening test *tells us* the field is conservative (Option A). However, the Gold Answer explicitly clarifies: ""Remember that the screening test can only rule out conservativity --- it can never, by itself, guarantee conservativity. So, A is *never* the case."" This means if the curl is zero, the screening test ""does not tell us whether $\vF$ is conservative or not"" (Option C).

Based on this discrepancy in understanding:
1.  **Part a**: $\vF=x\hi + z\hj + y\hk$. The curl is $\mathbf{0}$.
    *   Gold Answer: States Option C (the screening test does not tell us).
    *   Model Answer: States ""is conservative"" (implying Option A, which the gold states is never correct). This is a mismatch.

2.  **Part b**: $\vF=y^2z\hi + x^2z\hj + x^2y\hk$. The curl is not $\mathbf{0}$.
    *   Gold Answer: States Option B (the screening test tells us $\vF$ is not conservative).
    *   Model Answer: The answer is truncated (""is not""). Assuming it implies ""is not conservative"", this would align with Option B. However, the truncation makes it incomplete.

Furthermore, the model only provides answers for parts a and b, failing to complete the question which asks for all four parts (a, b, c, d).

**Solution:**

The sum of two conservative vector fields is also a conservative vector field. Therefore, if $\vF$ is conservative, then $\vF+(a,b,c)$ is also conservative. To find the potential for $\vF+(a,b,c)$, we simply add the potential functions of $\vF$ and $(a,b,c)$ together.

The model correctly determines that $\vF+(a,b,c)$ is always conservative. It explains that the sum of two conservative fields is conservative, and that $(a,b,c)$ is a conservative field (being the gradient of $ax+by+cz$). It also states in its prose that the potential for the sum is the sum of the potentials, which implies the potential is $\varphi+ax+by+cz$ (where $\varphi$ is the potential for $\vF$).

**Solution:**

The vector field $\vF$ is conservative on $D$ if and only if it satisfies the following condition:

$$\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y}$$

Calculating the partial derivatives, we get:

$$\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} = \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}$$

$$\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} = \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}$$

Therefore, the partial derivatives are not equal, so $\vF$"," The model incorrectly calculates the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y}$. It appears to have confused the partial derivatives with the components of the vector field itself.
The correct calculation shows that $\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} = \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$ and $\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} = \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$. These are, in fact, equal.
Because the partial derivatives are equal and the domain $D$ is simply connected, the vector field $\vF$ *is* conservative on $D$. The model's incorrect calculation leads it to the false conclusion that the partial derivatives are not equal, and thus (implicitly) that $\vF$ is not conservative, which contradicts the gold answer.

The line integral is $\int_C \vF\cdot\dee{\vr}$ with

We are to show that it is independent of path. That is the case if and
only if $\vF$ is conservative. So let's look for a potential $\varphi$
for $\vF$. That is, let's look for a function $\varphi$ that obeys
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(x,y) 
&= ye^x + \sin y \\
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}(x,y) &= e^x + \sin y + x \cos y

Integrating the first of these equations gives

**Solution:**

The line integral is independent of path if and only if the integrand is a perfect derivative. We can verify that the integrand is a perfect derivative as

$$\frac{\partial (ye^x + \sin y)}{\partial x} = e^x + \sin y$$

$$\frac{\partial (e^x + \sin y + x \cos y)}{\partial y} = \cos y + x \cos y$$

$$\int_C \vF\cdot \dee{\vr} = \int_0^1 \vF(\vr(t)) \cdot \frac{d\vr(t)}{dt} \ dt$$

where $C$ is parameterized by the"," The model's answer is incomplete. It only sets up the general formula for a line integral and does not propose any specific curve or calculate the integral. Therefore, it does not provide a final answer to the question. ",False
