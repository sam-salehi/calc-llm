A flower pot rolls out of a window 10m above the ground. How fast is it falling just as it smacks into the ground?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
From Example~\ref*{eg:fallingBallB}, we know that an object falling from rest on the Earth
is subject to the acceleration due to gravity, $9.8~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}$. So, if $h(t)$ is the height of the flower pot $t$ seconds after it rolls out the window, then $h''(t)=-9.8$. (We make the acceleration negative, since the measure ``height"" has ``up"" as the positive direction, while gravity pulls the pot in the negative direction, ``down."")

Then $h'(t)$ is a function whose derivative is the constant $-9.8$ and with $h'(0)=0$ (since the object fell, instead of being thrown up or down), so $h'(t)=-9.8t$.

What we want to know is $h'(t)$ at the time $t$ when the pot hits the ground. We don't know yet exactly what time that happens, so we go a little farther and find an expression for $h(t)$. The function $h(t)$ has derivative $-9.8t$ and $h(0)=10$, so (again following the ideas in Example~\ref*{eg:fallingBallB})
\[h(t)=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+10\]
Now, we can find the time when the pot hits the ground: it is the time when $h(t)=0$\\ (and $t>0$).
\begin{align*}
0&=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+10\\
\frac{9.8}{2}t^2&=10\\
t^2&=\frac{20}{9.8}\\
t&=+\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\approx1.4 ~\mathrm{sec}
\intertext{The velocity of the pot at this time is}
h'\left(\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\right)&=-9.8\left(\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\right)=-\sqrt{20\cdot 9.8}
=-14 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}
\end{align*}

So, the pot is falling at 14 metres per second, just as it hits the ground.
\end{solution}",Applications of Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The flower pot is in free fall, so its acceleration is 9.8m/s^2. We can use the equation of motion for a falling object to find its velocity just as it hits the ground:

$$v = \sqrt{2a(h)}$$

where v is the velocity of the object, a is its acceleration, and h is the height of the object above the ground. Substituting the values of a and h into this equation, we get:

$$v = \sqrt{2(9.8)(10)} = 4.35m/s$$

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The flower pot is falling at a speed of 4.35m/s just as it smacks into the ground."," The model incorrectly calculates the value of $\sqrt{2(9.8)(10)}$. The correct calculation is $\sqrt{196} = 14$. The model provides 4.35 m/s, which is incorrect and does not match the gold answer of 14 m/s. ",False
prob_s3.1.tex,"\begin{question}
A peregrine falcon can dive at a speed of 325 kph. If you were to drop a stone, how high up would you have to be so that the stone reached the same speed in its fall?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is $9.8$ metres per second squared. So, the object's velocity $t$ seconds after being dropped is
\[v(t)=9.8t~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\]
We want $v(t)$ to be the speed of the peregrine's dive, so we should convert that to metres per second:
\[325~\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{hr}}\cdot
\left(\frac{1000~\mathrm{m}}{1~\mathrm{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1~\mathrm{hr}}{3600~\mathrm{sec}}\right)=\frac{1625}{18}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\]
The stone will reach this velocity when
\[9.8t=\frac{1625}{18}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad t=\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\]

What is left to figure out is how far the stone will fall in this time. The position of the stone $s(t)$ has derivative $9.8t$, so
\[s(t)=4.9t^2\]
if we take $s(0)=0$. So, if the stone falls for $\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}$ seconds, in that time it travels
\[s\left(\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\right)=4.9\left(\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\right)^2\approx 416 ~\mathrm{m}\]
So, you would have to drop a stone from about 416 metres for it to fall as fast as the falcon.
\end{solution}",Applications of Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The stone will accelerate due to gravity at a rate of 9.8 m/s². To reach a speed of 325 kph, the stone would have to cover a distance of:

$$s = \frac{v^2}{2a}$$

where s is the distance traveled, v is the final speed, and a is the acceleration. Substituting the values into this equation, we get:

$$s = \frac{(325\text{ km/h})^2}{2(9.8\text{ m/s}^2)} = 10.1\text{ m}$$

Final Answer: 10.1 meters."," The model uses the correct physical formula ($s = v^2 / (2a)$), but fails to correctly convert the speed from kilometers per hour (kph) to meters per second (m/s) before performing the calculation. The acceleration due to gravity is given in m/s², so the speed must also be in m/s for unit consistency.

The correct conversion is:
$325~\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{hr}} \cdot \left(\frac{1000~\mathrm{m}}{1~\mathrm{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1~\mathrm{hr}}{3600~\mathrm{sec}}\right) = \frac{325000}{3600}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}} = \frac{1625}{18}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}} \approx 90.28~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}$

Using this corrected speed in the formula:
$s = \frac{(90.28~\mathrm{m/s})^2}{2(9.8~\mathrm{m/s}^2)} = \frac{8150.48~\mathrm{m^2/s^2}}{19.6~\mathrm{m/s}^2} \approx 415.84~\mathrm{m}$

**Solution:**

The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.

The change in volume of a cone is given by the formula ΔV = πr^2Δh.

In this problem, we have r = 0.5m and h = 2m. So, the volume of the water in the tank is V = (1/3)π(0.5)^2(2) = 0.523 cubic meters.

The change in height of the water is Δh = -5cm = -0.05m. So, the change in volume of the water is ΔV = π(0.5)^2(-0.05) = -0.026 cubic meters.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: -0.026 cubic meters."," The model makes a fundamental error in applying the concept of change in volume for a cone. It incorrectly assumes that the radius `r` in `ΔV = πr^2Δh` is the constant radius of the tank's top (0.5 m).

For a conical tank standing on its pointy end, the radius of the water surface changes with the height of the water. This relationship must be established using similar triangles. The tank has radius $R=0.5$ m at height $H=2$ m. For water at height $h$ with radius $r$, we have $r/h = R/H$, so $r = (R/H)h = (0.5/2)h = h/4$.

The volume of water is $V(h) = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left(\frac{h}{4}\right)^2 h = \frac{\pi h^3}{48}$.

The change in volume $\Delta V$ is estimated using the differential: $\Delta V \approx V'(h_0) \Delta h$.
First, find $V'(h)$: $V'(h) = \frac{3\pi h^2}{48} = \frac{\pi h^2}{16}$.
The initial height is $h_0 = 50 \text{ cm} = 0.5 \text{ m}$.
The change in height is $\Delta h = 45 \text{ cm} - 50 \text{ cm} = -5 \text{ cm} = -0.05 \text{ m}$.

Now, calculate $V'(0.5)$: $V'(0.5) = \frac{\pi (0.5)^2}{16} = \frac{0.25\pi}{16} = \frac{\pi}{64}$.

Finally, estimate $\Delta V$: $\Delta V \approx V'(0.5) \Delta h = \frac{\pi}{64} (-0.05) = -\frac{0.05\pi}{64} = -\frac{\pi}{1280}$.

Numerically, $-\frac{\pi}{1280} \approx -0.00245 \text{ m}^3$.

The model's approach of using $\Delta V = \pi r^2 \Delta h$ with $r=0.5$m is incorrect because this $r$ is the radius of the entire tank's top, not the radius of the water at the given height $h=0.5$m.

We measured $q=0.9$, but we want to know what the change in $h$ is if $q$ moves by 0.05. So, let $\Delta q= \pm 0.05$, and let $\Delta h$ be the corresponding change in $h$.
The linear approximation tells us
\begin{align*}\Delta h& \approx h'(0.9)\Delta q

\left|\Delta h\right|&\approx\left| h'(0.9)\right|\left|\Delta q\right|= h'(0.9)\cdot 0.05

Then, we will find $h'(0.9)$. Finally, the equation $\left|\Delta h\right|=h'(0.9)\cdot0.05$ will tell us the change in $h$ that corresponds with a change of 0.05 in our measurement.}

Let us find the half-life of the isotope, if after three years $q$ $\mu$g is remaining. The amount of the isotope present after $t$ years is given by
\begin{align*}
Q(t)&=Q(0)e^{-kt}
\intertext{for some constant $k$. Let's take $t=0$ to be the time when precisely one $\mu$g was present. Then}
Q(t)&=e^{-kt}

q&=e^{-k\cdot 3}\\
q^{\frac{1}{3}}&=e^{-k}\\
Q(t)&=\left(e^{-k}\right)^t=q^{\frac{t}{3}}
\intertext{The half-life is the value of $t$ for which $Q(t)=\frac{1}{2}Q(0)=\frac{1}{2}$.}
\frac{1}{2}&=Q(t)=q^{\frac{t}{3}}\\
\log\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)&=\log\left(q^{\frac{t}{3}}\right)\\
-\log 2 &=\frac{t}{3}\log q\\
t&=\frac{-3\log 2}{\log q}
\end{align*}
So, we calculate the half-life to be $\dfrac{-3\log 2}{\log q}$. This gives us our first goal: a function $h(q)$ that tells us the calculated half-life of the element.
\begin{align*}h(q)&=\dfrac{-3\log2}{\log q}
\intertext{Following our plan, we find $h'(0.9)$.}
h'(q)&=\diff{}{q}\left\{\dfrac{-3\log2}{\log q}\right\}\\
&=-3\log 2\cdot\diff{}{q}\left\{\left(\log q\right)^{-1}\right\}\\
&=-3\log 2\cdot(-1)\left(\log q\right)^{-2}\cdot\frac{1}{q}\\
&=\frac{3\log 2}{q\log^2q}\\
h'(0.9)&=\frac{3\log2}{0.9\log^2(0.9)}\approx 208
\intertext{Finally, as outlined in our plan, }
\left|\Delta h\right|&=h'(0.9)\cdot0.05\\
&=\frac{3\log2}{18\log^2(0.9)}\approx 10.4
\end{align*}
If our measurement changes by $\pm 0.05$ $\mu$g, then we estimate our calculated half-life changes by about $\pm$10.4 years. Since our measurement is accurate to within $0.05$ $\mu$g, that means we estimate
our calculated half-life to be accurate to within about 10.4 years.

Remark: since $h(0.9)=\dfrac{-3\log 2}{\log 0.9} \approx 19.7$, an absolute error of 10.4 years corresponds to a percentage error of $100\dfrac{10.4}{19.7}\approx 53\%$. The question did not specify absolute or percentage error. Since both make sense, you can use either one.

**Solution:**

The half-life of a radioactive isotope is given by the formula:

$$N = No\exp(-\lambda t)$$

where N is the number of atoms remaining, No is the number of atoms initially present, λ is the decay constant, and t is time.

We know that No = 1 μg, N = 0.9 μg, and t = 3 years. We can use this information to find the decay constant λ:

$$\lambda = \frac{\ln(N/No)}{-t}$$

$$\lambda = \frac{\ln(0.9/1)}{-3} = -0.105 year^{-1}$$

The accuracy of the half-life is given by the formula:

$$\Delta T = T\frac{\Delta N}{No}$$

where ΔT is the accuracy of the half-life, T is the half-life, ΔN is the accuracy of the number of atoms remaining, and No is the number of atoms initially present.

We can use this formula to find the accuracy of the half-life:

$$\Delta T = 3\frac{0.05}{1} = 0.015 years$$

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The accuracy of the half-life calculated using the given measurement is 0.015 years."," The model's approach to calculating the accuracy of the half-life is fundamentally incorrect. It uses a formula $\Delta T = T\frac{\Delta N}{No}$ which is not applicable for this type of error propagation. This formula appears to be a misapplication of a relative error formula, and the variable 'T' within it is ambiguously used as the initial time rather than the half-life itself.

The correct method, as demonstrated by the gold answer, involves using differential approximation ($|\Delta h| \approx |h'(q)||\Delta q|$), where $h(q)$ is the function relating the measured amount $q$ to the calculated half-life.

The model's final answer of 0.015 years is significantly different from the gold answer of approximately 10.4 years, indicating a flawed methodology. ",False

**Solution:**

The second-order Taylor polynomial for $f(x)= \tan x$ about $x=0$ is given by

Final Answer:  |f(0.1)-T_2(0.1)|  \leq 0."," The model's approach to calculating the error bound is fundamentally flawed.
1.  **Incorrect Taylor Remainder Formula:** The model uses $|f(x)-T_2(x)| \leq \frac{M_2(x-a)^2}{n!}$. For the $n$-th order Taylor polynomial $T_n(x)$, the error bound is given by the Lagrange form of the remainder $R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$ for some $c$ between $a$ and $x$. For $n=2$, this should involve the third derivative $f'''(c)$, and the term $(x-a)^3/3!$. The model uses $M_2$ and $(x-a)^2/n!$, which is incorrect for a second-order polynomial's error.
2.  **Incorrect Calculation of $M_2$**: The model defines $M_2=\max\{ |f''(x)| \text{ for } 0 \leq x \leq a \}$. While the definition of $M_2$ here is problematic in itself (it should be $M_3 = \max\{|f'''(x)|\}$ for the correct remainder formula), even with its own definition, $f''(x) = 2\sec^2 x \tan x$. For $x \in (0, 0.1]$, $f''(x)$ is positive and not zero. The model incorrectly states $M_2=0$, likely confusing $f''(0)=0$ with the maximum over the interval. This directly leads to an incorrect error bound of 0.
3.  **Logically Incorrect Final Answer**: The error $|f(0.1)-T_2(0.1)|$ cannot be 0, as $f(x)=\tan x$ is not identically $T_2(x)=x$ for $x \neq 0$. The gold solution correctly calculates a non-zero, positive bound. ",False

 Find the largest open interval on which $f(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{x-1}}{2x+4}$ is increasing.

Since we can't take the square root of a negative number,  $f(x)$ is only defined
when $x \ge 1$. Furthermore, since we can't have zero as a denominator, $x=-2$ is  not in the domain --- but as long as $x \ge 1$, we also have $x \ne -2$. So, the domain of the function is $[1,\infty)$.

Find the work (in joules) required to lift a 3-gram block of matter a height of 10 centimetres against the force of gravity (with $g=9.8$ m/sec$^2$).
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Force is mass $\times$ acceleration (with acceleration equal to $g$ in this problem), and both in this scenario are constant, so we don't need an integral--only a product--to calculate the force acting on the block.

To find the force in newtons, recall one newton is one $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}$, so we need the mass of our block in kg. Specifically, our block has mass $\frac{3}{1000}$ kg. So, the force involved is
\[F=\left(\frac{3}{1000}\text{ kg}\right)\times\left(9.8~\frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}\right) = 0.0294~\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} = 0.0294~\text{N}\]

To find the work in joules, recall one joule is one newton-metre: that is, one newton of force acting over one metre. So, we need our distance in metres.
\[W = \big( 0.0294~\text{N}\big)\times\left(\frac{1}{10}~\text{m}\right) = 0.00294~\text{N}\cdot\text{m} = 0.00294~\text{J}\]
\end{solution}",Applications of Integration,CLP2,"

**Solution:**

The work required to lift an object is given by the formula:

$$W = F\times d\times\cos\theta$$

where W is the work done, F is the force applied, d is the distance over which the force is applied, and theta is the angle between the force and the direction of motion.

In this case, the force applied is the force of gravity, which is given by the formula:

$$F = mg$$

where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Substituting this formula for F into the formula for work, we get:

$$W = mgh$$

where h is the height of the object above its initial position.

Now, we can calculate the work required to lift the 3-gram block of matter a height of 10 centimetres:

$$W = (0.003kg)(9.8m/s^2)(0.1m) = 0.0294 joules$$

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The work required to lift a 3-gram block of matter a height of 10 centimetres against the force of gravity is 0.0294 joules."," The model's final numerical answer is incorrect.
The calculation for work is $W = mgh$.
Given:
m = 3 grams = 0.003 kg
g = 9.8 m/s^2
h = 10 centimetres = 0.1 m

$W = (0.003 \text{ kg}) \times (9.8 \text{ m/s}^2) \times (0.1 \text{ m})$
$W = (0.0294 \text{ N}) \times (0.1 \text{ m})$
$W = 0.00294 \text{ J}$

The model calculated $W = 0.0294$ joules, which is the value of $mg$ (the force), not $mgh$ (the work). It appears to have missed multiplying by the height (0.1 m) in the final step of its calculation presented. ",False

Put another way, since $a$ and $b$ both describe a quantity in metres, $b-a$ describes a quantity in metres as well. (When we add or subtract quantities of the same units, their sum or difference is given in the same units.) Since $n$ is a unitless quantity (simply a number: not ``$n$ kg"" or ``$n$ m""), $\frac{b-a}{n}$ still describes a quantity in metres. (If I have 6 metres of cloth, and I cut it into 3 pieces, each piece has $\frac{6}{3}=2$ metres--not 2 kilograms, or 2 metres per second.)

 \item Since $F(x)$ is measured in kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons), the units of $F(x_i)$ are kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons).

\item $W$ is calculated by adding up summands of the form $F(x_i)\Delta x$. The units of $F(x_i)\Delta x$ are the products of the units of $F(x_i)$ with the units of $\Delta x$.

By Definition \eref{CLP101}{def:WKwork} in the CLP-2 text, the work done in moving the object from $x = 1$ meters

\begin{align*}

Since $x$, a distance, is measured in  meters, $a$ has to have the bizarre
units newton-$\sqrt{\text{meter}}\text{s}$.
\end{solution}",Applications of Integration,CLP2,"

**Solution:**

The work done by a variable force is given by the formula

$$W = \int_a^b F(x) dx$$

where $W$ is the work done, $F(x)$ is the force function, $a$ and $b$ are the limits of integration.

In this problem, we have

$$F(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{x}}$$

$$W = 18$$

$$a = \frac{W \sqrt{x}}{A}$$

where $A$ is the area under the curve of the force function between $x = 1$ and $x = 16.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: $a = \frac{18 \sqrt{16}}{ \int_1^{16} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx } = 2$."," The model correctly identifies the formula for work done ($W = \int F(x) dx$) and the given values. However, its derivation to solve for 'a' is fundamentally flawed.

The work done is $W = \int_1^{16} \frac{a}{\sqrt{x}} dx = a \int_1^{16} x^{-1/2} dx$.
The integral $\int_1^{16} x^{-1/2} dx = [2\sqrt{x}]_1^{16} = 2\sqrt{16} - 2\sqrt{1} = 2(4) - 2(1) = 8 - 2 = 6$.
So, $W = a \cdot 6$.
Given $W = 18$, we have $18 = 6a$, which implies $a = 3$.

The model's final calculation is $a = \frac{18 \sqrt{16}}{ \int_1^{16} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx }$.
This simplifies to $a = \frac{18 \times 4}{6} = \frac{72}{6} = 12$.
The inclusion of $\sqrt{16}$ in the numerator is incorrect and leads to the wrong answer. The correct formula to solve for 'a' from $W = a \int_1^{16} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx$ would be $a = \frac{W}{\int_1^{16} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx}$.

Using Equation~\eref{CLP101}{eq:TRQcentroid} in the CLP-2 text with $T(x) = 2x\sin (x^2)$ and $B(x)=0$,

\[\bar x = \frac{\displaystyle\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} 2x^2\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}}{\displaystyle\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} 2x\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}}\]

We can evaluate the bottom integral exactly with the substitution $u=x^2$, $\dee{u}=2x\dee{x}$. When $x=0$, $u=0$, and when $x=\sqrt{\pi/2}$, $u=\pi/2$.

\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}}2x\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}&=\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin u\,\dee{u}
=\Big[-\cos u\Big]_0^{\pi/2}=1\\
\end{align*}

So, \[\bar x = \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} 2x^2\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x} \]

Evaluating the integral $\int x^2\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}$ is not so simple\footnote{Indeed, the antiderivative of $2x^2\sin(x^2)$ is not expressible as an elementary function.}, so we use a numerical approximation. Since we're given an upper bound on the fourth derivative, we decide to use Simpson's rule. The error involved using Simpson's rule with $n$ intervals is at most $\frac{L(b-a)^5}{180n^4}$. For our approximation,  $a=0$ and $b=\sqrt{\pi/2}$. According to the information given in the problem statement,
$\left|\ddiff{4}{}{x}\left\{2x^2\sin(x^2)\right\} \right| \leq 415$ over the interval $\left[0,\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right]$, so  we set $L=415$.

We want our final error to be no more than $\frac{1}{100}$, so we want to find an even $n$ such that:
\begin{align*}
\frac{415\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}-0\right)^5}{180n^4} &\leq \frac{1}{100}\\
n^4 &\geq \frac{415\cdot 100\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{5/2}}{180} = \frac{2075\pi^{5/2}}{36\sqrt{2}}\\
n&\geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{2075\pi^{5/2}}{36\sqrt{2}}}\approx 5.17
\end{align*}
So, $n=6$ intervals suffices.

It calculates $\sqrt{e^{2t}+4t^2+1}$, which should be $\sqrt{e^{2t}+(2t+1)^2+1^2} = \sqrt{e^{2t}+4t^2+4t+2}$ if its $\vv(t)$ was correctly used. Furthermore, it incorrectly includes ""dt"" in the expression for the speed $\diff{s}{t}$, which is a rate.
*   **D. $\hT(t)$:** This expression is incorrect because it uses the model's incorrect $\vv(t)$ (3D) and its incorrect $|\vv(t)|$ (magnitude calculation error).
*   **E. $\ka(t)$:** The formula used for curvature is not the most standard or simplest for this context, and the final expression $\frac{1}{\sqrt{e^{2t}+4t^2+1}}$ is incorrect. It appears to simply be the reciprocal of its incorrect speed calculation, not the curvature.

**SOLUTION:**

The osculating circle to a helix is given by the formula

$$\vr(t) = \big(\cos at, \sin at, bt\big), \text{ where } a,b \text{ are constants and } t \text{ is a parameter}$$

The radius of curvature of this helix is given by

$$r_c = \frac{b}{a}$$

The center of the osculating circle is given by

$$\vr_c = \vr(t) - \frac{r_c}{a} \hat{n}(t)$$

where $\hat{n}(t)$ is the unit normal vector to the helix at the point $\vr(t)$.

In this problem, we have

$$\vr(t) = \big(\cos t, \sin t, t\big)$$

So, we have

$$a = 1, \text{ } b = 1$$

Therefore, the radius of curvature is

$$r_c = \frac{1}{1} = 1$$

The center of curvature is

$$\vr_c = \big(\cos t, \sin t, t\big) - \frac{1}{1} \hat{n}(t)$$

Final Answer:

The radius of curvature of the osculating circle to the helix 

$$\vr(t) = \big(\cos t, \sin t, t\big)$$

at the point where $t=\pi/6$ is 1."," The model provides an incorrect formula for the radius of curvature of the given helix type.
The radius of curvature for a helix $\vr(t) = (a\cos t, a\sin t, bt)$ is $R = \frac{a^2+b^2}{a}$. For $\vr(t) = (\cos t, \sin t, t)$, we have $a=1$ and $b=1$.
Thus, the correct radius of curvature is $R = \frac{1^2+1^2}{1} = 2$.
The model states the radius of curvature is $r_c = b/a = 1/1 = 1$, which is incorrect.

**Solution:**

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The curvature of the curve $C$ is $\kappa(t) = \sqrt{6}$ at $t = 0.","
The model provides incorrect formulas and calculations for several parts of the question.

1.  **Part (a) - Unit tangent vector $\hat\vT(t)$:**
    *   Gold: $\hat\vT(t) =\frac{t^2\,\hi + \sqrt{2} t\,\hj + \hk}{t^2+1}$
    *   Model: $\hat\vT(t) = \frac{t^2\mathbf{i}+t\sqrt{2}\mathbf{j}+ \mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{t^4+2t^2+1}}$
    *   Reasoning: The denominator $\sqrt{t^4+2t^2+1} = \sqrt{(t^2+1)^2} = t^2+1$ for all real $t$. Thus, the model's answer for part (a) is symbolically equivalent and correct.

2.  **Part (b) - Curvature $\kappa(t)$:**
    *   Gold: $\kappa(t) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{{(t^2+1)}^2}$
    *   Model: $\kappa(t) = \frac{|\vr''(t)|}{\sqrt{\vr'(t)\cdot\vr'(t)}}= \frac{\sqrt{6}}{ \sqrt{t^4+2t^2+1}}$
    *   Reasoning: The formula used by the model for curvature, $\kappa(t) = \frac{|\vr''(t)|}{|\vr'(t)|}$, is generally incorrect unless the curve is parameterized by arc length (i.e., $|\vr'(t)|=1$). The correct formula is $\kappa(t) = \frac{|\vr'(t)\times\vr''(t)|}{|\vr'(t)|^3}$. Additionally, even if we were to use the model's incorrect formula, $|\vr''(t)| = |2t\mathbf{i} + \sqrt{2}\mathbf{j}| = \sqrt{4t^2+2}$, not $\sqrt{6}$. The calculation for $|\vr''(t)|$ is incorrect. Therefore, the model's expression for $\kappa(t)$ is incorrect.

3.  **Part (c) - Evaluate $\kappa(t)$ at $t = 0$:**
    *   Gold: $\kappa(0) = \sqrt{2}$
    *   Model: $\kappa(0) = \sqrt{6}$
    *   Reasoning: Based on the incorrect formula and calculation in part (b), the value $\kappa(0) = \sqrt{6}$ is incorrect.

4.  **Part (d) - Principal normal vector $\hat\vN(t)$ at $t = 0$:**
    *   Gold: $\hat\vN(0) = \hj$
    *   Model: $\hat\vN(t) = \frac{\partial\hat\vT(t)}{\partial t}= \frac{-t\sqrt{2}\mathbf{i}-t^2\mathbf{j}- \mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{t^4+2t^2+1}}$. At $t=0$, this yields $-\mathbf{k}$.
    *   Reasoning: The formula used by the model, $\hat\vN(t) = \frac{\partial\hat\vT(t)}{\partial t}$, is incorrect. The principal normal vector is $\hat\vN(t) = \frac{\hat\vT'(t)}{|\hat\vT'(t)|}$. The model omitted the necessary normalization. Furthermore, the calculation of $\hat\vT'(t)$ itself is incorrect. At $t=0$, $\hat\vT'(0) = \sqrt{2}\mathbf{j}$ (as shown in gold), so $\hat\vN(0) = \mathbf{j}$. The model's result of $-\mathbf{k}$ is incorrect.

5.  **Part (e) - Binormal vector $\hat\vB(t)$ at $t = 0$:**
    *   Gold: $\hat\vB(0) = -\hi$
    *   Model: $\hat\vB(t) = \hat\vT(t)\times\hat\vN(t)= \frac{t\sqrt{2}\mathbf{i}-t^2\mathbf{j}- \mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{t^4+2t^2+1}}$. At $t=0$, this yields $-\mathbf{k}$.
    *   Reasoning: While the formula $\hat\vB(t) = \hat\vT(t)\times\hat\vN(t)$ is correct, the model used its incorrectly calculated $\hat\vN(t)$. Therefore, the resulting $\hat\vB(t)$ and its value at $t=0$ are incorrect. The model's result of $-\mathbf{k}$ does not match the gold answer of $-\hi$.

The model's final answer only states $\kappa(t)=\sqrt{6}$ at $t=0$, which is incorrect and does not address all parts of the question.

At what points in the $xy$-plane does the curve $(\sin t, t^2)$ cross itself? What is the difference in $t$ between the first time the curve crosses through a point, and the last?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The curve ``crosses itself"" when the same coordinates occur for different values of $t$, say $t_1$ and $t_2$. So, we want to know when $\sin t_1=\sin t_2$ and also $t_1^2=t_2^2$. Since $t_1$ and $t_2$ should be different, the second equation tells us $t_2=-t_1$. Then the first equation tells us $\sin t_1=\sin t_2=\sin(-t_1)=-\sin t_1$. That is, $\sin t_1 = -\sin t_1$, so $\sin t_1=0$. That happens whenever $t_1=\pi n$ for an integer $n$.

So, the points at which the curve crosses itself are those points $(0,(\pi n)^2)$ where $n$ is an integer. It passes such a point at times $t=\pi n $ and $t=-\pi n$. So, the curve hits this point $2\pi n$ time units apart.

**Solution:**

The curve given by the parametric equation

$$(\sin t, t^2)  \text{ for } 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$$

crosses itself at the points where

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{ \frac{dy}{dt} }{ \frac{dx}{dt} } = \frac{\frac{dt^2}{dt} }{ \frac{dx}{dt} } = 0$$

$$\Rightarrow t = 0, \pi, 2\pi$$

Final Answer: The curve crosses itself at the points $(0,0), (\pi, \pi^2),  and $(2\pi, 4\pi^2)$."," The model's approach to finding points where the curve crosses itself is fundamentally incorrect. The condition $\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ or $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$ relates to horizontal or vertical tangents, not self-intersections. A curve crosses itself when it passes through the same $(x,y)$ coordinates for *different* values of $t$.

Furthermore, the model introduces an arbitrary domain $0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$ which is not specified in the question, thus limiting the generality of the answer. Even with this incorrect method and assumed domain, the derivation of $t=0, \pi, 2\pi$ is flawed and inconsistent with the stated conditions ($\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ only yields $t=0$).

While the points $(0,0)$, $(0,\pi^2)$, and $(0,4\pi^2)$ are indeed self-intersection points, the model's method for finding them is wrong. The question asks for *all* such points, which the gold answer correctly identifies as $(0, (\pi n)^2)$ for any integer $n$. The model only provides a subset of these.

Crucially, the model completely fails to answer the second part of the question: ""What is the difference in $t$ between the first time the curve crosses through a point, and the last?"". ",False

A particle traces out a curve in space, so that its position at time $t$ is \[\vr(t)=e^{-t}\,\hi+\frac{1}{t}\,\hj+(t-1)^2(t-3)^2\,\hk\] for $t > 0$. 

Let the positive $z$ axis point vertically upwards, as usual. When is the particle moving upwards, and when is it moving downwards? Is it moving faster at time $t=1$ or at time $t=3$?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
To determine whether the particle is rising or falling, we only need to consider its $z$-coordinate: $z(t)=(t-1)^2(t-3)^2$. Its derivative with respect to time is $z'(t)=4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)$. This is positive when $1<t<2$ and when $3<t$, so the particle is increasing on $(1,2) \cup (3,\infty)$ and decreasing on $(0,1) \cup (2,3)$.

If $\vr(t)$ is the position of the particle at time $t$, then its speed is $|\vr'(t)|$. We differentiate:
\[\vr'(t)=-e^{-t}\,\hi-\frac{1}{t^2}\,\hj+4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)\hk\]
So, $\vr(1)=-\frac{1}{e}\,\hi-1\,\hj$ and $\vr(3)=-\frac{1}{e^3}\,\hi-\frac{1}{9}\,\hj$. The absolute value of every component of $\vr(1)$ is greater than or equal to that of the corresponding component of $\vr(3)$, so $|\vr(1)|>|\vr(3)|$. That is, the particle is moving more swiftly at $t=1$ than at $t=3$.

Note: We could also compute the sizes of both vectors directly: $|\vr'(1)|=\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{e}\right)^2+(-1)^2}$, and $|\vr'(3)|=\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{e^3}\right)^2+\left(-\frac{1}{9}\right)^2}$.
\end{solution}",Curves,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

The particle is moving upwards when its position vector is pointing upwards, which is when the $z$-component of the position vector is positive. The $z$-component of the position vector is given by the function

$$z(t)= (t-1)^2(t-3)^2$$

Therefore, the particle is moving upwards when

$$z(t)>0$$

This is true for all $t>1$.

The particle is moving downwards when its position vector is pointing downwards, which is when the $z$-component of the position vector is negative. The particle is moving downwards when

$$z(t)<0$$

This is true for $0<t<1$.

The particle is moving faster at time $t=1$ than at time $t=3$ because the speed of the particle is given by the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector with respect to time. The magnitude of the derivative of the position vector with respect to time is given by the function

$$v(t)= \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy(t)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz(t)}{dt}\right)^2}$$

Therefore, the speed of the particle is

$$v(1)= \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx(1)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy(1)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz(1)}{dt}\right)^2}= \sqrt{11}$$

$$v(3)= \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx(3)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy(3)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz(3)}{dt}\right)^2}= \sqrt{1}$$

Therefore, the particle is moving faster at time $t=1$ than at time $t=3$.

**Final Answer:**

The particle is moving upwards for all $t>1$ and moving downwards for $0<t<1$. The particle is moving faster at time $t=1$ than at time $t=3$.","
The model makes two significant errors:

1.  **Determining upwards/downwards motion:** The particle is moving upwards when its *vertical component of velocity* is positive, i.e., $z'(t) > 0$. The model incorrectly states it's moving upwards when the *vertical position* $z(t) > 0$. The derivative $z'(t)$ must be calculated and its sign analyzed.
    *   $z(t)=(t-1)^2(t-3)^2$.
    *   $z'(t) = 4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)$.
    *   $z'(t) > 0$ for $t \in (1,2) \cup (3,\infty)$ (moving upwards).
    *   $z'(t) < 0$ for $t \in (0,1) \cup (2,3)$ (moving downwards).
    *   The model's conclusion that the particle is moving upwards for all $t>1$ and downwards for $0<t<1$ is incorrect.

2.  **Comparing speeds:** The model correctly states the method (comparing magnitudes of the velocity vector), but the calculated numerical values for the speeds are incorrect.
    *   $\vr'(t)=-e^{-t}\,\hi-\frac{1}{t^2}\,\hj+4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)\hk$
    *   At $t=1$: $\vr'(1) = -e^{-1}\,\hi - 1\,\hj + 0\,\hk$. Speed $|\vr'(1)| = \sqrt{(-e^{-1})^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{e^{-2} + 1}$. The model gives $\sqrt{11}$, which is wrong.
    *   At $t=3$: $\vr'(3) = -e^{-3}\,\hi - \frac{1}{9}\,\hj + 0\,\hk$. Speed $|\vr'(3)| = \sqrt{(-e^{-3})^2 + (-1/9)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{e^{-6} + 1/81}$. The model gives $\sqrt{1}$, which is wrong.

Although the final qualitative conclusion about which time the particle is moving faster (t=1) is correct, it is based on fundamentally flawed intermediate calculations and reasoning.

For the given curve, we have

$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^2\right)=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t$$

Substituting this into the formula for arclength, we get

$$s=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+ \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t\right)^2} dt$$

This integral does not have an elementary solution, so we must use numerical methods to find the arclength.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The arclength of the curve

$$\vr(t)=\left(t,\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^2,t^3\right)$$

from $t=0$ to $t=1$ is given by

$$s=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+ \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t\right)^2} dt$$"," The model uses the incorrect formula for the arclength of a 3D parametric curve. It applies the formula for a 2D Cartesian curve ($y=f(x)$) instead of the formula for a vector-valued function $\vr(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$, which involves the magnitude of the derivative vector $\left|\diff{\vr}{t}(t)\right|$.

Specifically, the model:
1.  Uses $s=\int_a^b \sqrt{1+ \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} dx$, which is incorrect for the given 3D curve. The correct formula is $\int_{a}^b\left| \diff{\vr}{t}(t)\right|\dee t$.
2.  Incorrectly calculates $\frac{dy}{dx}$ (interpreted as $\frac{dy}{dt}$), neglecting the $x(t)$ and $z(t)$ components of the vector function and making an error in the derivative of $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^2$. The derivative of $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^2$ is $\sqrt{6}t$, not $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t$.
3.  Sets up an incorrect integral $\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+ \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t\right)^2} dt$.
4.  Incorrectly claims that the integral it derived ""does not have an elementary solution"". The correct integral (from the gold answer) is $\int_0^1(3t^2+1)\dee t$, which is straightforward to evaluate.
5.  Provides an integral expression as the ""final answer"" instead of the numerical value requested by ""find the arclength"".

**Answer:**

The curve of intersection of the parabolic cylinder $x = y^2$ and the hyperbolic paraboloid $3z = 2xy$ with $y\ge 0$ is given by the vector equation

$$\vec{r}(t) = \langle y(t), x(t), z(t) \rangle = \langle t, t^2, \frac{2t}{3} \rangle, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 3$$

where $y(t) = t$, $x(t) = t^2$, and $z(t) = (2/3)t.

The length of the part of $C$ between the origin and the point $(9, 3, 18)$ is given by the formula

$$L = \int_0^3 \sqrt{\frac{dx^2}{dt} + \frac{dy^2}{dt} + \frac{dz^2}{dt}} dt$$

where

$$\frac{dx^2}{dt} = \frac{dy^2}{dt} = 1$$

$$\frac{dz^2}{dt} = \frac{2}{3}$$

Substituting these values into the formula for length, we get

$$L = \int_0^3 \sqrt{1 + 1 + \frac{2}{3}} dt = 9$$

Final Answer: 9"," The model's answer is incorrect for several reasons:
1.  **Part (a) Incorrect Parameterization:** The question asks for a vector parametric equation using $x$ as the parameter. The model uses $t$ as a parameter and defines $y(t)=t$ and $x(t)=t^2$, meaning it's using $y$ as the parameter. Furthermore, its calculation for $z(t)$ is incorrect based on its chosen $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. If $x=t^2$ and $y=t$, then $3z=2xy=2(t^2)(t)=2t^3$, so $z=\frac{2}{3}t^3$, not $\frac{2t}{3}$ as stated by the model. The gold answer correctly uses $x$ as the parameter resulting in $\mathbf{r}(x) = \langle x, \sqrt{x}, \frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} \rangle$.
2.  **Part (b) Incorrect Setup and Calculation:**
    *   The model uses its incorrect parametrization from part (a).
    *   It incorrectly calculates the squares of the derivatives needed for arc length. It states $\frac{dx^2}{dt} = 1$ and $\frac{dz^2}{dt} = \frac{2}{3}$. Based on its own given parametrization $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t, t^2, \frac{2t}{3} \rangle$:
        *   $dy/dt = 1 \implies (dy/dt)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. (This matches the model's $\frac{dy^2}{dt}=1$).
        *   $dx/dt = 2t \implies (dx/dt)^2 = (2t)^2 = 4t^2$. (The model incorrectly states $\frac{dx^2}{dt}=1$).
        *   $dz/dt = 2/3 \implies (dz/dt)^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9$. (The model incorrectly states $\frac{dz^2}{dt}=\frac{2}{3}$).
    *   Based on these incorrect derivatives, the model then calculates the integral as $L = \int_0^3 \sqrt{1 + 1 + \frac{2}{3}} dt = \int_0^3 \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} dt = 3\sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} = 2\sqrt{6}$. However, its final stated answer for part (b) is 9, which does not match its own derived result or the correct answer (21) from the gold solution.

**Solution:**

The angular momentum of a particle is given by

In this problem, we have

$$\vr=(\sin t, \cos t, t)$$

$$\vv=(\cos t, -\sin t, 1)$$

So,

$$\vL=m(\vr\times\vv)=m(\sin t\hat{i}-\cos t\hat{j}+t\hat{k})\times(\cos t\hat{i}-\sin t\hat{j}+ \hat{k})=m(\sin t\hat{i}\times\cos t\hat{j}- \cos t\hat{i}\times\hat{k}+t\hat{j}\times\hat{k})=m\hat{k}$$

**Final Answer:**

$$\left|\diff{\vL}{t} \right|=m$$","
The model's solution contains fundamental errors in vector calculation and differentiation.
1.  **Incorrect Vector Representation:** The model initially writes $\vr$ as $(\sin t\hat{i}-\cos t\hat{j}+t\hat{k})$, which incorrectly changes the sign of the y-component from $\cos t$ to $-\cos t$. The correct representation from the problem statement is $\vr=(\sin t, \cos t, t) = \sin t\hat{i} + \cos t\hat{j} + t\hat{k}$.
2.  **Incorrect Cross Product Calculation:** The model attempts to calculate the cross product $\vL=m(\vr\times\vv)$. Using the (incorrect) $\vr$ and correct $\vv$, the model lists `m(\sin t\hat{i}\times\cos t\hat{j}- \cos t\hat{i}\times\hat{k}+t\hat{j}\times\hat{k})=m\hat{k}`. This calculation is completely wrong.
    *   $\sin t\hat{i}\times\cos t\hat{j} = \sin t \cos t (\hat{i}\times\hat{j}) = \sin t \cos t \hat{k}$
    *   $-\cos t\hat{i}\times\hat{k} = -\cos t (-\hat{j}) = \cos t \hat{j}$
    *   $t\hat{j}\times\hat{k} = t\hat{i}$
    Summing these terms yields $t\hat{i} + \cos t \hat{j} + \sin t \cos t \hat{k}$, which is not $m\hat{k}$.
    The correct calculation of $\vL$ (with $m=1$) is $\vL = (\cos t + t\sin t)\hat{i} + (t\cos t - \sin t)\hat{j} - \hat{k}$.
3.  **Inconsistent Final Answer:** The model concludes that $\vL=m\hat{k}$. If this were true, then $\frac{d\vL}{dt} = \vec{0}$, and its magnitude $|\frac{d\vL}{dt}|$ would be 0. However, the model provides a final answer of $m$ (which is $1$ since $m=1$). This is a contradiction within the model's own reasoning.

**Solution:**

The slope of the tangent line to a curve at a particular point is given by the derivative of the curve at that point. The derivative of the curve is found by taking the derivative of each component function with respect to time and then using the formula for the slope of the tangent line:

$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}$$

$$\frac{dx}{dt}=-\sin t$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=\cos t$$

\end{align*}
\end{solution}",Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The derivative of a quotient function is given by the formula:

$$ \dfrac{d}{dx} \left(\dfrac{u}{v}\right) = \dfrac{v\dfrac{du}{dx} - u\dfrac{dv}{dx}}{v^2} $$

where $u$ and $v$ are functions of $x$.

In this case, we have:

$$ u = 3x^2 + 5 $$

$$ v = 2 - x $$

So, we can compute the derivatives of $u$ and $v$:

$$ \dfrac{du}{dx} = 6x $$

$$ \dfrac{dv}{dx} = -1 $$

Substituting these derivatives into the formula for the derivative of a quotient function, we get:

$$ \dfrac{d}{dx} \left(\dfrac{3x^2+5}{2-x}\right) = \dfrac{(2-x)(6x) - (3x^2+5)(-1)}{ (2-x)^2 } $$

$$ \dfrac{d}{dx} \left(\dfrac{3x^2+5}{2-x}\right) = \dfrac{6x - 3x^2 - 5}{ (2-x)^2 } $$"," The model correctly sets up the quotient rule. The expression before the final answer block is correct: $\dfrac{(2-x)(6x) - (3x^2+5)(-1)}{ (2-x)^2 }$.

However, the model's stated ""Final Answer"" is $\dfrac{6x - 3x^2 - 5}{ (2-x)^2 }$.
Let's simplify the correct numerator:
$(2-x)(6x) - (3x^2+5)(-1)$

**Answer:**

The derivative of $g(x)=f(x)e^x$ is given by

$$g'(x)=[f(x)+f'(x)]e^x$$

Therefore, the second derivative of $g(x)$ is

$$g''(x)=[f(x)+f'(x)]e^x+e^x[f''(x)]$$

And the third derivative of $g(x)$ is

$$g'''(x)=[f(x)+f'(x)]e^x+e^x[f''(x)]+e^x[f'''(x)]$$

$$g^{(4)}(x)=[f(x)+f'(x)]e^x+e^x[f''(x)]+e^x[f'''(x)]+e^x[f^{(4)}(x)]$$

This formula checks out by differentiating the formula for $g^{(3)}(x)$ and verifying that it is equal to $g^{(4)}(x)$."," The model's calculations for $g''(x)$, $g'''(x)$, and $g^{(4)}(x)$ are incorrect.

*   **Model's Answer:** $[f(x)+f'(x)]e^x+e^x[f''(x)] = [f(x)+f'(x)+f''(x)]e^x$. This is incorrect. The model seems to have made an error in applying the product rule.

For part (b), $g'''(x)$:

*   **Model's Answer:** $[f(x)+f'(x)]e^x+e^x[f''(x)]+e^x[f'''(x)] = [f(x)+f'(x)+f''(x)+f'''(x)]e^x$. This is incorrect, following from the error in part (a).

For part (c), $g^{(4)}(x)$:

Furthermore, the model's ""verification"" for $g^{(4)}(x)$ is also incorrect. If we differentiate the model's simplified $g'''(x) = [f(x)+f'(x)+f''(x)+f'''(x)]e^x$, we get:

The model's approach is to find $f'(x)$ and then try to solve the equation $f'(x)=0$ for $x$. While calculating the derivative is a correct first step, attempting to solve $e^x + 2(1-e)x = 0$ explicitly for $x$ is not generally feasible using elementary functions and, more importantly, it does not constitute a ""showing of existence"" via a fundamental theorem. The model's ""Final Answer"" for $c$ is an implicit equation ($c = \frac{e^{\frac{c}{2}}}{2(e-1)}$ if $x$ is meant to be $c$), not a concrete value, and it misses the underlying mathematical concept required to prove existence. The step $x = \frac{e^x}{2(e-1)} = \frac{e^{\frac{x}{2}}}{2(e-1)}$ is also an incorrect algebraic manipulation ($e^x$ does not become $e^{x/2}$).

The Mean Value Theorem states that for a function $h$ that is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the interval $(a,b)$, the following equation holds:

\end{solution}",Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient function,

$$g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{h(x)}$$

is given by

$$g'(x) = \frac{h(x)f'(x) - f(x)h'(x)}{h(x)^2}$$

where f'(x) and h'(x) are the derivatives of f(x) and h(x) respectively.

In the case of the tangent function,

$$\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$$

we have

$$\sin'(x) = \cos(x)$$

$$\cos'(x) = - \sin(x)$$

Substituting these derivatives into the quotient rule formula, we get

$$\tan'(x) = \frac{\cos(x)\cos(x) - \sin(x)(-\sin(x))}{(\cos(x))^2}$$

$$\tan'(x) = \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{(\cos(x))^2}$$

$$\tan'(x) = \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{(\cos(x))^2}$$"," The model's final answer, $\frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{(\cos(x))^2}$, is symbolically equivalent to the gold answer's final form, $\sec^2\theta$.

Evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}
                 \dfrac{\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^5 x}$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Recall that $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{\sin x}{x} =1$. In order to take advantage of this knowledge, we divide the numerator and denominator by $x^5$ (because $5$ is the power of sine in the denominator, and a denominator that goes to zero generally makes a limit harder).

\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}  \dfrac{\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^5 x}

\end{align*}
Now the denominator goes to 1, which is nice, but we need to take care of the fraction $\dfrac{\sin x^{27}}{x^5}$ in the numerator. This fraction isn't very familiar, but we know that, as $x$ goes to zero, $x^{27}$ also goes to zero,

\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}  \dfrac{\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^5 x}
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}  \dfrac{x^{22}\dfrac{\sin x^{27}}{x^{27}}+2 e^{x^{99}}}{\left(\dfrac{\sin x}{x}\right)^5}

**Solution:**

The limit of the function

$$\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^5 x}$$

$$\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^5 x} = \lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}})}{\frac{d}{dx}(\sin^5 x)} = \lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^{26} x + 10x^4 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^4 x} = 0$$

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The total volume of noise produced by ten speakers is 30dB, and the total volume of noise produced by one hundred speakers is also 30dB."," The model incorrectly assumes that decibel levels add linearly with the number of speakers. Decibels are a logarithmic scale, so doubling the intensity (e.g., from one to two identical speakers) results in an increase of approximately 3 dB, not a doubling of the decibel value.

For 10 speakers: $V(10P) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{10P}{S}\right) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{S}\right) + 10\log_{10}(10) = 3 + 10(1) = 13 \text{ dB}$.
For 100 speakers: $V(100P) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{100P}{S}\right) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{S}\right) + 10\log_{10}(100) = 3 + 10(2) = 23 \text{ dB}$.

**Final Answer:**

$$\ds\diff{}{x}\left\{[f(x)]^{g(x)}\right\} = g(x)f'(x) [f(x)]^{g(x)-1}  \ln(f(x))$$"," The gold answer uses logarithmic differentiation to correctly find the derivative:
$\ds\diff{}{x}\left\{[f(x)]^{g(x)}\right\} = [f(x)]^{g(x)}\left(g'(x)\ln(f(x))+g(x)\cdot\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)$
This can be expanded as:
$\ds\diff{}{x}\left\{[f(x)]^{g(x)}\right\} = [f(x)]^{g(x)}g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + [f(x)]^{g(x)}g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$
The second term can be simplified: $[f(x)]^{g(x)}g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = g(x)f'(x)[f(x)]^{g(x)-1}$.

The model correctly finds the velocity vector in part (a).

**Solution:**

The vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is equal to 0.

For the first vector,

$$\vec{a} = \langle 2, 4 \rangle, \vec{b} = \langle 2, y \rangle$$

$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = 2(2) + 4y = 0$$

$$4 + 4y = 0$$

$$4y = -4$$

$$y = -1$$

For the second vector,

$$\vec{a} = \langle 4, -1 \rangle, \vec{b} = \langle y, y^2 \rangle$$

$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = 4y - y^2 = 0$$

$$y(4 - y) = 0$$

$$4 - y = 0$$

$$y = 4$$

For the third vector,

$$\vec{a} = \langle 3, 1, 1 \rangle, \vec{b} = \langle 2, 5y, y^2 \rangle$$

$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = 6 + 5y - y^2 = 0$$

$$y(6 - y) = 0$$

$$6 - y = 0$$

$$y = 6$$

The values of $y$ for which the given vectors are perpendicular are -1, 4, and 6."," The model correctly determined the value for part (a) as $y=-1$.

prob_s1.2.tex,"\begin{question}
A marble is placed on the plane $ax+by+cz=d$. The coordinate
system has been chosen so that the positive $z$--axis points straight up.
The coefficient $c$ is nonzero and the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are not
both zero.
In which direction does the marble roll? 
Why were the conditions ``$c\ne 0$'' and ``$a,b$ not both zero'' imposed?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The marble is subject to two forces. The first, gravity, is
$-mg\,\hk$ with $m$ being the mass of the marble. The second is the normal
force imposed by the plane. This forces acts in a direction perpendicular
to the plane. One vector normal to the plane is $a\,\hi+b\,\hj+c\,\hk$. 
So the force due to the plane is $T\llt a,b,c\rgt$ with $T$ determined  by the
property that the net force perpendicular to the plane must be exactly
zero, so that the marble remains on the plane, neither digging into nor
flying off of it. The projection of the gravitational force onto the normal
vector $\llt a,b,c\rgt$ is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt\cdot\llt a,b,c\rgt}{|\llt a,b,c\rgt|^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt
=\frac{-mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt
\end{equation*}
The condition that determines $T$ is thus
\begin{equation*}
T\llt a,b,c\rgt+\frac{-mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt =0
\implies T=\frac{mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}
\end{equation*}
The total force on the marble is then (ignoring friction -- which will
have no effect on the direction of motion)
\begin{align*}
T\llt a,b,c\rgt-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt&=\frac{mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt\cr
&=mg\frac{c\llt a,b,c\rgt-\llt 0,0,a^2+b^2+c^2\rgt}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\cr
&=mg\frac{\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\cr
\end{align*}
The direction of motion $\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt$. If you want to turn
this into a unit vector, just divide by $\sqrt{(a^2+b^2)(a^2+b^2+c^2)}$.
Note that the direction vector in perpendicular $\llt a,b,c\rgt$ and hence is parallel
to the plane. If $c=0$, the plane is vertical. In this case, the marble
doesn't roll -- it falls straight down. If $a=b=0$, the plane is horizontal.
 In this case, the marble doesn't roll --- it remains stationary.
\end{solution}",Geometry in two and three dimensions,CLP3,"

**Solution:**

The marble will roll in the direction of the negative $x$-axis. This is because the coefficient $c$ is nonzero, which means that the marble will experience a force in the direction of the $z$-axis. The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, which means that the marble will also experience a force in the direction of the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis. The net force on the marble will be in the direction of the negative $x$-axis.

Final Answer: The marble rolls in the direction of the negative $x$-axis."," The model's final answer for the direction the marble rolls is ""the negative $x$-axis"". This is incorrect; the direction of rolling depends on the coefficients $a, b, c$ of the plane and is generally a vector in 3D space, as shown in the gold answer ($\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt$). The model provides a specific direction that is not generally true. Furthermore, the model fails to correctly explain why the conditions ``$c\ne 0$'' and ``$a,b$ not both zero'' were imposed. It mentions that forces are experienced in certain directions but does not explain the physical implications for the marble's motion (e.g., if $c=0$, the plane is vertical and the marble falls; if $a=b=0$, the plane is horizontal and the marble is stationary).

(a) $AA'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and $BB'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ are opposite sides
of the quadrilateral $AA'B'B$. They have the same length 
and direction. The same is true for $AB=\llt -1,3,0\rgt $ and 
$A'B'=\llt -1,3,0\rgt $. So $AA'B'B$ is a parallelogram. Because, 
$AA'\cdot AB=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt -1,3,0\rgt =-4\ne 0$, 
the neighbouring edges of $AA'B'B$ are not perpendicular and so $AA'B'B$ 
is \emph{not} a rectangle.

Similarly, the quadilateral $ACC'A'$ has opposing sides
$AA'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt =CC'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and 
$AC=\llt -1,0,4\rgt =A'C'=\llt -1,0,4\rgt $ and so is
a parallelogram. Because $AA'\cdot AC=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt -1,0,4\rgt = 0$, the neighbouring edges of $ACC'A'$ are perpendicular, so
$ACC'A'$ \emph{is} a rectangle.

Finally, the quadilateral $BCC'B'$ has opposing sides
$BB'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt =CC'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and 
$BC=\llt 0,-3,4\rgt =B'C'=\llt 0,-3,4\rgt $ and so is
a parallelogram. Because $BB'\cdot BC=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt 0,-3,4\rgt 
= 4\ne 0$, the neighbouring edges of $BCC'B'$ are not perpendicular, so 
$BCC'B'$ is \emph{not} a rectangle.

(c) The area of a triangle is one half its base times its height.

$\theta$ is the angle between $AB$ and $AC$. This is precisely 
$\half |AB\times AC|=\half|\llt -1,3,0\rgt \times\llt -1,0,4\rgt |

(d) The volume of the prism is the area of its base $ABC$,
 times its height, which is the length of $AA'$ times the cosine of the
angle between $AA'$ and the normal to $ABC$. This coincides with
$\half \llt 12,4,3\rgt \cdot\llt 4,0,1\rgt =\half(48+3)=\frac{51}{2}$, which is 
one half times the length of $\llt 12,4,3\rgt $ (the area of $ABC$)

$\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ (the angle between the normal to $ABC$ and $AA'$).

**Solution:**

The given prism has six vertices and the coordinates of those vertices are given in the problem. We can see that three of the faces are parallelograms. This is because the opposite sides of the parallelogram are parallel to each other and the diagonals are perpendicular to each other.

The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula:

$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

where A is the area of the parallelogram, h is the height of the parallelogram, and b is the base of the parallelogram.

The area of the triangle ABC is 

$$A = \frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6$$ square units.

The volume of a prism is given by the formula:

$$V = A\times h$$

where V is the volume of the prism, A is the area of the base of the prism, and h is the height of the prism.

The volume of the prism is

$$V = (6)(4) = 24$$ cubic units.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The area of the triangle ABC is 6 square units and the volume of the prism is 24 cubic units.","
The model's final answers for the area of triangle ABC and the volume of the prism are incorrect.
For part (c), the gold answer for the area of triangle ABC is $\frac{13}{2} = 6.5$, while the model gives 6. The model's calculation of the area assuming a right-angled triangle with legs 3 and 4 is incorrect; the given vertices do not form such a triangle.
For part (d), the gold answer for the volume of the prism is $\frac{51}{2} = 25.5$, while the model gives 24. The model's calculation uses an incorrect base area (from its incorrect part c) and an arbitrary height of 4 (the actual length of $AA'$ is $\sqrt{17}$, and the height of the prism is the projection of $AA'$ onto the normal of the base, or derived from the scalar triple product, not just the length of $AA'$).

Furthermore, the model did not attempt parts (a) or (b) in its final answer, and its reasoning for part (a) was flawed (e.g., ""diagonals are perpendicular to each other"" for a parallelogram is generally false). The model did not calculate the length of $AA'$ at all.

$$\int_S\vec{F}\cdot\hat{n}dS=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\sqrt{2}}4r\sin(\phi)dr\sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi=4\pi$$

Final Answer:  The flux of $x\hi+y\hj+2z\hk$ through the part of the ellipsoid 

$$x^2+y^2+2z^2=2$$

with $z\ge 0$ is $4\pi$."," The model's final answer of $4\pi$ is incorrect. The correct answer, as shown in the gold solution, is $\frac{16}{3}\pi$.

The model makes a critical error in applying the Divergence Theorem. The theorem relates the flux through a *closed* surface to the volume integral of the divergence. The given surface is only the *part* of the ellipsoid with $z \ge 0$, which is an *open* surface (a half-ellipsoid). To use the Divergence Theorem, one must consider the closed surface of the solid region, which includes the half-ellipsoid and the circular base (disk) at $z=0$.

The gold solution correctly identifies this by defining the solid $V$ as the half-ellipsoid and its base disk $D$. It then states:
$$
\dblInt_S\vF\cdot\hn\ \dee{S}
+\dblInt_D\vF\cdot(-\hk)\,\dee{S}
=\tripInt_V\vnabla\cdot\vF\ \dee{V}
$$
The gold solution correctly calculates the divergence $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 4$. It then correctly determines that the flux through the base disk $D$ is zero, as $\mathbf{F} \cdot (-\mathbf{k}) = (x\mathbf{i}+y\mathbf{j}+2z\mathbf{k}) \cdot (-\mathbf{k}) = -2z$, and $z=0$ on $D$.

The model, however, attempts to directly compute the flux through $S$ by integrating the divergence over a volume, which it incorrectly sets up as a spherical integral (not an ellipsoid) and miscalculates. Specifically, the integral $\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\sqrt{2}}4r\sin(\phi)dr\sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi$ is neither the correct integral for the volume of the ellipsoid nor correctly evaluated to $4\pi$. If it were meant to be a volume integral of $4$, it should be $\int 4 dV = \int 4 r^2 \sin\phi dr d\phi d\theta$ (for spherical coordinates), and the limits would need to be adapted for an ellipsoid, not a sphere. Even if it were for a sphere of radius $\sqrt{2}$, evaluating the model's written integral yields $16\pi$, not $4\pi$.

Therefore, the model's approach is fundamentally flawed for this problem, leading to an incorrect result. ",False

(a)
By the vector identity $\vnabla\cdot\big(\vnabla\times\vG\big)=0$ 
(Theorem \eref{CLP317}{thm:degTwoIdentities}.a of the CLP-4 text).
So we must have
\begin{align*}
0&=\vnabla\cdot\vF
  =\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial x}\big(xz\big)
   + \frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial y}\big(axe^y z + byz\big)

 &= z + \big(axe^y z+bz\big) + \big(-2xe^yz\big) \\
 &= (1+b)z + (a-2)x e^y z

So we need $a=2$ and $b=-1$.

(b)
Note that the boundary, $\partial S$, is the circle $x^2+y^2=1$, $z=0$,
oriented counter-clockwise. Also note that, if we knew what $\vG$ was,
we would be able to use Stokes' theorem to give
\begin{align*}
\dblInt_S\vF\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
&= \dblInt_S(\vnabla\times\vG)\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
=\oint_{\partial S} \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}
\end{align*}
So let's find a vector potential $\vG$.
That is, let's try and find a vector field 
$\vG= G_1\,\hi + G_2\,\hj + G_3\,\hk$ that obeys $\vnabla\times\vG = \vF$,
or equivalently,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial G_3}{\partial y} -\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial z} &= F_1 
         =xz\\
-\frac{\partial G_3}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial z}&=F_2
         =2xe^y z - yz \\
\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial y}&=F_3
         =y^2 - xe^y z^2
\end{align*}
Let's also require that $G_3=0$. (If this is mysterious to you,
review \S\eref{CLP317}{sec:vectorPotential} in the CLP-4 text.)
Then the equations above simplify to
 \begin{align*}
 -\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial z} &=xz\\
  \frac{\partial G_1}{\partial z} &=2xe^y z - yz \\
\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial y}&=y^2 - xe^y z^2
\end{align*}
Now  the first equation contains only a single unknown, namely $G_2$ and we 
can find all $G_2$'s that obey the first equation simply by integrating 
with respect to $z$:
\begin{equation*}
G_2 = -\frac{xz^2}{2} + N(x,y)
\end{equation*}
Note that, because $\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial z}$ treats $x$ and $y$
as constants, the constant of integration $N$ is allowed to depend on $x$ 
and $y$. 

Similarly, the second equation contains only a single unknown,
$G_1$, and is easily solved by integrating with respect to $z$. 
The second equation is satisfied if and only if
\begin{equation*}
G_1 = xe^y z^2 - \frac{1}{2}yz^2 + M(x,y)
\end{equation*}
for some function $M$. 

Finally, the third equation is also satisfied
if and only if $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ obey
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial x}\Big(-\frac{xz^2}{2} + N(x,y)\Big) 
-\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial y}\Big(xe^yz^2-\frac{yz^2}{2} + M(x,y)\Big)
     =y^2 - xe^y z^2
\end{equation*}
which simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}(x,y) -\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}(x,y) =y^2
\end{equation*}
This is one linear equation in two unknowns, $M$ and $N$. 
Typically, we can easily solve one linear equation in one unknown. 
%So we are free to eliminate one of the unknowns by setting, for example, 
%$N=0$, and then choose any $M$ that obeys
%\begin{equation*}
%-\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}(x,y) = y^2
%\end{equation*}
%Integrating with respect to $y$ gives, as one possible choice, $M(x,y) = -\frac{y^3}{3}$. So we have found a vector potential. Namely
%\begin{equation*}
%\vG = \Big( xe^y z^2 - \frac{1}{2}yz^2 - \frac{y^3}{3}\Big)\,\hi 
%         -\frac{xz^2}{2}\,\hj

So we are free to eliminate one of the unknowns by setting, for example, 
$M=0$, and then choosing any $N$ that obeys
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}(x,y) = y^2

\begin{equation*}
\vG = \Big( xe^y z^2 - \frac{1}{2}yz^2\Big)\,\hi 
       +\Big(xy^2  -\frac{xz^2}{2}\Big)\,\hj

We can now evaluate the flux. Parametrize $\partial S$

$$\vF(x, y, z) = xz\,\hi + (axe^y z + byz)\,\hj + (y^2 - xe^y z^2 )\,\hk$$

The boundary of the surface is the curve $C$, which is the intersection of the plane $x+y+z=1$ with the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. The surface is oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above.

The integrand should be the dot product of the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ with the unit normal vector $\mathbf{n}$.
2.  **Incorrect Partial Derivative Calculation:** For $\mathbf{F} = P\mathbf{i} + Q\mathbf{j} + R\mathbf{k} = z\mathbf{i} + x\mathbf{j} - y\mathbf{k}$, we have $P=z$, $Q=x$, $R=-y$.

\end{solution}",Integral Theorems,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

The vector field $\vA$ is a vector potential if and only if it satisfies the following condition:

$$\partial A_1/\partial y = \partial A_2/\partial z = \partial A_3/\partial x = 0$$

For the first vector field,

$$\partial A_1/\partial y = \partial (1+yz)/\partial y = 1$$

$$\partial A_2/\partial z = \partial (2y+zx)/\partial z = x$$

$$\partial A_3/\partial x = \partial (3z^2+xy)/\partial x = 0$$

Therefore, the vector field $\vA_1$ is not a vector potential.

For the second vector field,

$$\partial A_1/\partial y = \partial (yz)/\partial y = z$$

$$\partial A_2/\partial z = \partial (zx)/\partial z = y$$

$$\partial A_3/\partial x = \partial (xy)/\partial x = 0$$

Therefore, the vector field $\vA_2$ is a vector potential.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The vector field $\vA_2$ is a vector potential, while the vector field $\vA_1$ is not."," The model fundamentally misunderstands the definition of a vector potential. A vector field $\vA$ is a vector potential for a given vector field $\vF$ if $\vF = \vnabla \times \vA$. The problem asks to find such a vector field $\vA$.

The model incorrectly states that ""The vector field $\vA$ is a vector potential if and only if it satisfies the following condition: $\partial A_1/\partial y = \partial A_2/\partial z = \partial A_3/\partial x = 0$"". This condition is incorrect and irrelevant to finding a vector potential.

Furthermore, the model then applies its incorrect condition to the given vector fields $\vF$ and $\vG$ themselves (referring to them as $\vA_1$ and $\vA_2$), rather than attempting to find a separate vector field $\vA$ such that $\vnabla \times \vA = \vF$ or $\vG$.

For part (a), the gold answer correctly determines that $\vF$ cannot have a vector potential because its divergence $\vnabla \cdot \vF = 2+6z \ne 0$. The model does not check this necessary condition. Its conclusion for (a) is accidentally correct (no potential exists), but the reasoning and calculations provided by the model are entirely wrong.

For part (b), the gold answer correctly finds explicit forms of $\vA$ that serve as a vector potential for $\vG$. The model does not attempt to find $\vA$. Instead, it again applies its incorrect conditions to the components of $\vG$ and incorrectly concludes that $\vG$ (referred to as $\vA_2$) ""is a vector potential."" This conclusion is based on erroneous logic and calculations (e.g., it computes $\partial(yz)/\partial y = z$, $\partial(zx)/\partial z = x$, $\partial(xy)/\partial x = y$, and deems these results satisfy some condition, which they do not, and which is not the condition for being a vector potential).

The model's approach and reasoning are entirely incorrect for both parts of the problem. ",False

**Final Answer:**

The washers formed by rotating $R$ about the $y$-axis are formed by taking thin slices of the region $R$ perpendicular to the $x$-axis and revolving each slice about the $y$-axis. The radius of each washer is given by the distance from the $y$-axis to the slice, which is $y$. The thickness of each washer is given by the width of the slice, which is $dx$. Therefore, the area of each washer is given by the formula:

$$A = \pi r^2 dx$$

where $r=y$ and $dx$ is the width of the slice.

Integrating this formula over the interval $0 \leq x \leq 6$, we find that the total area of the washers is given by the formula:

$$A_T = \int_0^6 \pi y^2 dx$$"," The model completely misunderstands the concept of washers for rotation about the y-axis.
1.  **Incorrect Slice Orientation:** For washers formed by rotating about the y-axis, the slices should be taken *perpendicular to the y-axis* (i.e., horizontally), meaning the thickness would be $dy$. The model states slices are perpendicular to the x-axis with thickness $dx$. This indicates a misunderstanding of the washer method for rotation about the y-axis.
2.  **Incorrect Radii:** The model states ""The radius of each washer is given by the distance from the y-axis to the slice, which is y."" This is incorrect. The radius is the $x$-value, and since it's a washer, there are inner and outer radii, both of which would be functions of $y$.
3.  **Incorrect Formula for Area/Volume:** The formula $A = \pi r^2 dx$ is for a disk, not a washer, and uses the incorrect thickness $dx$. The area of a washer is $\pi(R^2 - r^2)dy$.
4.  **No Sketch:** The question explicitly asks to ""Sketch the washers... In your sketch, label all the radii in terms of $y$, and label the thickness."" The model provides no sketch.
5.  **Incorrect Integration Setup:** The final integral $\int_0^6 \pi y^2 dx$ is fundamentally flawed, as it mixes variables, uses incorrect limits, and does not represent the volume of washers for this region. The integration should be with respect to $y$, and there would be different expressions for different ranges of $y$ (due to the shape of $f(x)$).

The model fails to provide any of the requested information (sketches, labeled radii in terms of y, labeled thickness) and demonstrates a severe conceptual error in applying the washer method. ",False

The model's answer is incorrect for both parts of the question.

For part (a):
The integral $\int \arctan x \dee{x}$ is not $\frac{1}{2}\ln(1+x^2)+C$. The correct indefinite integral using integration by parts is $x\arctan x - \frac{1}{2}\ln(1+x^2)+C$.
Therefore, the definite integral $\int_0^1\arctan x\ \dee{x}$ is not $\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)$.
The gold answer is $\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{1}{2}\log 2 \approx 0.4388$. The model's answer is $0.693$, which is numerically incorrect.

For part (b):
The question asks for an indefinite integral $\int\frac{2x-1}{x^2-2x+5}\ \dee{x}$.
The model's proposed antiderivative $\frac{1}{2}\ln|x^2-2x+5|+C$ is incorrect and incomplete. The derivative of this expression is $\frac{1}{2}\frac{2x-2}{x^2-2x+5} = \frac{x-1}{x^2-2x+5}$, which is not the original integrand.
The correct antiderivative involves two terms: $\log |x^2-2x+5| +\frac{1}{2}\arctan \frac{x-1}{2} +C$.
Furthermore, the model incorrectly treats the indefinite integral as a definite integral by evaluating it at limits, which is not what the question asked for. Even the numerical result it provides for its incorrectly calculated definite integral is based on an incorrect application of limits (it computes $\ln(4)$ but states $\frac{1}{2}\ln(4)$ in the previous line, and does not subtract the value at the lower limit).

**Solution:**

The integral is

$$\int_{\sqrt{10}}^{\sqrt{17}} \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\, \dee{x}= \int_{\sqrt{10}}^{\sqrt{17}} \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^2-1}} \dx$$

Let 

$$u=x^2-1$$

Then 

$$du=2x\ dx$$

Substituting these values into the integral, we get

$$\int_{\sqrt{10}}^{\sqrt{17}} \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\, \dee{x}= \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \du$$

This integral is

$$\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \du = \sqrt{u}+C$$

where C is a constant of integration.

Final Answer:

$$\int_{\sqrt{10}}^{\sqrt{17}} \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\, \dee{x}= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \sqrt{x^2-1} \right]  \bigl\lvert_{\sqrt{10}}^{\sqrt{17}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \sqrt{16}- \sqrt{10} \right]= 2- \sqrt{10}$$"," The model's final answer $2 - \sqrt{10}$ does not match the gold answer $\frac{40}{3}$.

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Our integrand is already in the nice form that would come out of a partial fractions decomposition.
Let's consider its different pieces.
\begin{itemize}
\item First piece: $\int \frac{3}{x^2+2}~\dee{x}$. The  fraction looks somewhat like the derivative of arctangent, so we can massage it to find an appropriate substitution.

\begin{align*}
\int \frac{3}{x^2+2}~\dee{x}&=\frac{3}{2}\int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt2}\right)^2+1}~\dee{x}

&=\frac{3}{\sqrt2}\arctan u+C\\
&=\frac{3}{\sqrt2}\arctan \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt2}\right)+C
\end{align*}

\item The next piece is $\int \frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}$.
If the numerator were only $x$ (and no constant), we could use the substitution $u=x^2+2$, $\dee{u} = 2x~\dee{x}$. So, to that end, we can break up that fraction into $\frac{x}{(x^2+2)^2}-\frac{3}{(x^2+2)^2}$. For now, we only evaluate the first half.

\begin{align*}
\int \frac{x}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}&=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{1}{u^2}~\dee{u} = -\frac{1}{2u}+C\\
&=-\frac{1}{2x^2+4}+C
\end{align*}

\item That leaves us with the final piece, $\frac{3}{(x^2+2)^2}$,  which is the hardest. We saw something similar in  Question~\ref{prob_s1.9:forpartialfractions} in Section 1.9: we can use the substitution $x=\sqrt{2}\tan\theta$, $\dee{x} = \sqrt{2}\sec^2\theta~\dee{\theta}$.
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{3}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}&=\int\frac{3}{(2\tan^2\theta+2)^2}\sqrt{2}\sec^2\theta~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\int\frac{3}{4\sec^4\theta}\sqrt{2}\sec^2\theta~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}\int\cos^2\theta~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\int\big(1+\cos(2\theta)\big)~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\left(\theta+\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)\right)+C\\
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\left(\theta+\sin\theta\cos\theta\right)+C\\

&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\left(\arctan\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt2}\right)+\frac{x\sqrt{2}}{x^2+2}\right)+C
\end{align*}
From our substitution, $\tan\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt2}$. So, we can draw a right triangle with angle $\theta$, opposite side $x$, and adjacent side $\sqrt2$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{x^2+2}$, and this gives us $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$.

**Solution:**

The integral is given by

$$\int\left(\frac{3}{x^2+2}+\frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}\right)~\dee{x}$$

We can separate the integral into two parts

$$\int\left(\frac{3}{x^2+2}+\frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}\right)~\dee{x}= \int\frac{3}{x^2+2}~\dee{x}+ \int\frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}$$

The first part is a simple integral of the form

$$\int\frac{1}{x^2+a}~\dee{x}= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{a}}\right)+C$$

where C is a constant of integration.

The second part is a more complex integral that requires the use of the following formula

$$\int\frac{1}{(x+a)^2}~\dee{x}= \frac{-1}{2a} \frac{1}{x+a}+C$$

where C is a constant of integration.

Combining the two parts, we have

$$\int\left(\frac{3}{x^2+2}+\frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}\right)~\dee{x}= \frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)- \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{x+2}+C$$

**Solution:**

The curves $y=x$ and $y=3x-x^2$ intersect at the points where their equations are equal.

$$\x=3x-x^2 \Rightarrow x^2 - 2x - x = 0 \Rightarrow x=0 \text{ or } x=2$$

Therefore, the area of the finite region between the curves $y=x$ and $y=3x-x^2$ is given by

$$\text{Area}=\int_0^2 \int_x^{3x-x^2} dx dy$$

$$\text{Area}=\int_0^2 \left[ \int_x^{3x-x^2} dx dy \right]  dx dy = \frac{1}{2}  \text{ square units}$$

Final Answer: The area of the finite region between the curves $y=x$ and $y=3x-x^2$ is 1/2 square units."," The model correctly identifies the points of intersection as $x=0$ and $x=2$.

To find the area between two curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ over an interval $[a,b]$, the integral should be $\int_a^b |f(x)-g(x)| dx$. In this case, it should be $\int_0^2 ((3x-x^2)-x) dx = \int_0^2 (2x-x^2) dx$.

The chosen part for $u$ is the function that is easy to antidifferentiate. The chosen part for $\dee{v}$ is the function that is easy to differentiate.

Is the integral $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}$
convergent or divergent? Explain why.

The integrand is positive everywhere. So either the integral
converges to some finite number or it is infinite. There are two potential
``sources of impropriety'' --- a possible singularity at $x=0$ and
the fact that the domain of integration extends to $\infty$.
So, we split up the integral.
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}
=\int_0^1\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}
  + \int_1^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}

(or recall Example \eref{CLP100}{eg:hopitalA} in the CLP-1 text),
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}
=\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\cos x}{1}
=\cos 0
=1
\end{equation*}
Consequently,
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}
=\Big(\lim_{x\to 0} \sin^2 x \Big)
\Big(\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \Big)
\Big(\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \Big)
=0\times 1\times 1
=0
\end{equation*}
and the first integral is not even improper.

Now for the second integral. Since $|\sin x|\le 1$, we'll compare it to $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}$ and $\frac{1}{x^2}$ are defined and continuous for every $x \geq 1$
\item $0 \leq \frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2} \leq \frac{1^4}{x^2} = \frac{1}{x^2}$ for every $x \geq 1$
\item $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}~\dee{x}$ converges by Example~\eref{CLP101}{eg:IMPp1}
 in the CLP-2 text (it's a $p$-type integral with $p>1$)

By the comparison test, Theorem~\eref{CLP101}{thm:IMPcomparison} in the CLP-2 text,
$\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}$ converges.

Since $\displaystyle\int_0^1\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}$ and $\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}$ both converge, we conclude

**Solution:**

The provided text describes a problem involving the evaluation of various sums. We can use the formulas from Theorems ~\eref{CLP101}{thm:INTsummationArith} and \eref{CLP101}{thm:INTspecialSums} to solve this problem.

For the first two sums, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series given by

$$\sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n = a_0 \frac{1-a_N}{1-a}$$

where $a_0$ is the first term, $a_N$ is the last term, and $a$ is the common ratio. In this case,

$$\sum_{i=0}^{100} \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^i = \frac{3/5}{1-3/5} = \frac{3}{2}=1.5$$

$$\sum_{i=50}^{100} \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^i = \frac{3/5}{1-3/5} \left(1- \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{50} \right) = \frac{3}{2}(1-0.001) = 1.5$$

For the third sum, we can use the formula for the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers given by

$$\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}$$

In this case,

$$\sum_{i=1}^{10} \left(i^2-3i+5\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{10} i^2 - 3\sum_{i=1}^{10} i + 5\sum_{i=1}^{10} 1 = \frac{10(11) (2(10)+1)}{6}-3(10)  + 5(10) = 105$$

For the fourth sum, we can use the formula for the sum of a series involving a constant multiple and a geometric series given by

$$\sum_{n=1}^{N} \left(\frac{1}{e}\right)^n + en^3 = \frac{1}{e} \sum","
The model's answers for all parts are incorrect or incomplete.

*   **Part (a):** The model used an incorrect formula for the geometric sum. The sum $\sum_{i=0}^{100} r^i$ is equal to $\frac{1-r^{101}}{1-r}$. The model's formula and application are incorrect. Specifically, it seems to use $a_0 = 3/5$ instead of $a_0 = (3/5)^0 = 1$, and its general formula for the sum of a geometric series is also incorrect.
*   **Part (b):** Similar to part (a), the model used an incorrect formula and application for the geometric sum. The sum $\sum_{i=50}^{100} (3/5)^i$ can be written as $(3/5)^{50} \sum_{k=0}^{50} (3/5)^k$, which is $(3/5)^{50} \frac{1-(3/5)^{51}}{1-3/5}$. The model's result is incorrect.
*   **Part (c):** The model correctly decomposed the sum but made a significant error in applying the sum formulas. For $\sum_{i=1}^{10} i$, it incorrectly used '10' instead of the correct value $\frac{10(11)}{2}=55$. So, its intermediate step $3(10)$ is wrong; it should be $3(55)$. Furthermore, its final numerical answer of '105' is incorrect. The correct answer is 270.
*   **Part (d):** The model only partially wrote out the solution and did not provide a final answer, making it incomplete.

The limit is a Riemann sum, which approximates the area below a graph of $y=f(x)$ integrated over the interval $[0,b]$ using $n$ rectangles of width $\frac{b}{n}$ and height $f(a_i)$ for each rectangle, where $a_i$ is the endpoint of the interval $[0,b]$ corresponding to the $i$-th rectangle.

The area is negative. The shape is a trapezoid with base length $(b - a)$ and heights

The integral

$$\int_a^b x\, \dee{x}$$

**Solution:**

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = h*w, where h is the height and w is the width. To estimate the area of a function using approximating rectangles, we first divide the interval of integration into equal-width subintervals. Then, we find the height of each rectangle by evaluating the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval. Finally, we multiply the height of each rectangle by its width and sum the areas of all the rectangles to estimate the area of the function.

In this problem, we have

$$\int_{-1}^5 x^3\ dx$$

We divide the interval [-1, 5] into three subintervals of width 2. The left endpoints of each subinterval are -1, 1, and 3. The height of each rectangle is given by the function value at the left endpoint of each subinterval:

$$h_1 = f(-1) = -1$$

$$h_2 = f(1) = 1$$

$$h_3 = f(3) = 9$$

The area of each rectangle is

$$A_i = h_i*w = -1*2 = -2$$

$$A_2 = h_2*w = 1*2 = 2$$

$$A_3 = h_3*w = 9*2 = 18$$

$$A_T = -2 + 2 + 18 = 18$$

Since $f(x)$ is linear, there exist real numbers $m$ and $c$ such that $f(x)=mx+c$. Now we can do some calculations. Suppose we have a rectangle in our Riemann sum that takes up the interval $[x,x+w]$.
\begin{itemize}
\color{blue} \item If we are using a left Riemann sum, our rectangle has height $f(x)=mx+c$.
Then it has area $w(mx+c)$. \color{red}

It follows that the midpoint Riemann sum has a value equal to the average of the values of the left and right Riemann sums. To see this, let the rectangles in the midpoint Riemann sum have areas $M_1,M_2,\ldots,M_n$,
let the rectangles in the left Riemann sum have areas $\textcolor{blue}{L_1,L_2,\ldots,L_n}$, and
let the rectangles in the right Riemann sum have areas $\textcolor{red}{R_1,R_2,\ldots,R_n}$. Then the midpoint Riemann sum evaluates to $M_1+M_2+\cdots+M_n$, and:

**Solution:**

The left and right Riemann sums approximate the area under the curve of $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ using the sum of the areas of rectangles. The midpoint Riemann sum approximates the area under the curve of $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ using the sum of the areas of rectangles with midpoints on the curve.

Show that there exists at least one real number $c$ such that $2\tan(c)=c+1$.

We let $f(x)=2\tan(x)-x-1$. Then $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the interval $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ since $\tan(x)=\sin(x)/\cos(x)$ is continuous on this interval, while $x+1$ is a polynomial and therefore continuous for all real numbers.

We find a value $a\in (-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ such that $f(a)<0$. We observe immediately that $a=0$ works since
$$f(0)=2\tan(0)-0-1=0-1=-1<0.$$

There exists at least one real number $c$ such that $2\tan(c)=c+1$."," The model's reasoning is fundamentally flawed and does not correctly prove the existence of such a real number $c$.

 Define $f(t)=g(\va+t\vd)$ and determine $t_0$ by

To see this, write $\va=\llt a_1,a_2,a_3\rgt$ and $\vd=\llt d_1,d_2,d_3\rgt$.
Then 
\begin{equation*}

where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{v}=\frac{\partial \vx}{\partial t}$.

Therefore, if $t_0$ is a local minimum or maximum of the function $f(t)=g(\va+t\vec{v})$ then

$$\frac{\partial g(\vx_0)}{\partial t}=0$$

Final Answer: If $t_0$ is a local minimum or maximum of the smooth function $f(t)=g(\va+t\vec{v})$ then

$$\frac{\partial g(\vx_0)}{\partial t}=0$$","
The question asks for a necessary condition that ""should involve the gradient of g(x)"".
The Gold Answer correctly derives and states the condition as $\vnabla g(\vx_0)\cdot\vd=0$, which explicitly involves the gradient $\vnabla g(\vx_0)$ and the direction vector $\vd$.

The Model's final answer is $\frac{\partial g(\vx_0)}{\partial t}=0$. While this statement is mathematically correct in the context of the defined function $f(t)=g(\va+t\vec{v})$, it does not explicitly express the condition in terms of the gradient $\vnabla g(\vx_0)$ and the direction vector $\vd$, as requested by the problem. One must perform the chain rule expansion (which the model attempts but executes poorly in its derivation) to see the involvement of the gradient.

Furthermore, the model's derivation contains significant flaws and confusing notation:
1.  It incorrectly refers to $\frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial t}$ as ""The gradient of $g(\vx)$ with respect to $t$"". The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates, not a scalar derivative with respect to `t`.
2.  The line `$$\frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial t}= \frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial t}=v_1\frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial x_1}+v_2\frac{\partial g(\vx)}{\partial x_2}=0$$` is mathematically ill-formed. It equates the derivative to itself and then to 0, implying the derivative is always zero, which is incorrect. The derivative is only zero at a critical point.
3.  The model introduces $\vec{v}$ as a ""unit vector"" which is incorrect; $\vec{v}$ (or $\vd$) is simply the direction vector of the line and is not necessarily a unit vector.

Due to the lack of explicit gradient involvement in the final answer and the significantly flawed derivation, the model's answer is considered incorrect.

Since $\vnabla h = \llt -4\,,\,-2 \rgt$ is never zero,
$h$ has no critical points and the minimum of $h$ on the disk

**Solution:**

The function $h(x,y) = -4x - 2y + 6$ is defined on the closed bounded domain $D = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \}$. To find the minimum of $h(x,y)$ on $D$, we first find the critical points of $h(x,y)$ within the domain. To do this, we find the partial derivatives of $h(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, set them equal to 0, and solve the resulting system of equations.

The critical points of $h(x,y)$ within the domain are $$\left( \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$$

The minimum of $h(x,y)$ on $D$ is then found by evaluating $h(x,y)$ at these critical points and selecting the minimum value.

**Final Answer:**

The minimum of the function $h(x,y) = -4x - 2y + 6$ on the closed bounded domain defined by $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ is

$$-6$$"," The model's final answer of $-6$ does not match the gold answer of $6-2\sqrt{5}$. The gold answer is approximately $1.528$, while the model's answer is $-6$.
The model's approach is also fundamentally flawed. The function $h(x,y) = -4x - 2y + 6$ is a linear function, and its gradient $\nabla h = \langle -4, -2 \rangle$ is never zero. This means there are no critical points in the interior of the domain. The model incorrectly states that the critical points are $(\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$. Consequently, the minimum must occur on the boundary, which the model fails to analyze. ",False

The model's answer is incorrect for both parts of the question.

For part (a):
1.  The model correctly calculates the partial derivatives `g_x = 2x` and `g_y = -2y - 10`.
2.  However, when setting these to zero to find critical points, `2x=0` gives `x=0` and `-2y-10=0` gives `y=-5`. Thus, the *only* critical point is `(0, -5)`. The model incorrectly lists `(√2, -5)` and `(-√2, -5)` as critical points.
3.  The model does not classify the critical point(s), which was a requirement of part (a).

For part (b):
1.  The model only lists values of `g` at the incorrectly identified critical points from part (a) as the absolute extrema.
2.  None of these points `(0, -5)`, `(√2, -5)`, `(-√2, -5)` are within the specified bounded region `x^2+4y^2 ≤ 16, y ≤ 0`. For example, for `(0,-5)`, `0^2 + 4(-5)^2 = 100`, which is not less than or equal to `16`. Therefore, these points cannot be the absolute extrema on the given region.

If $f(x,y)=e^x+e^y+K$, then $f_x(x,y) = e^x$ and $f_y(x,y) = e^y$.
However, the question states $f_x(x,y)=e^y$ and $f_y(x,y)=e^x$. These are inconsistent with the model's proposed solution.

Furthermore, the model makes an error in its integration step. If $f_x(x,y)=e^y$, then integrating with respect to $x$ yields $f(x,y) = \int e^y dx = xe^y + C(y)$, not $e^x+C(y)$ as stated by the model.

The correct approach, as demonstrated by the gold answer, is to check the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's Theorem).
Given $f_x(x,y)=e^y$ and $f_y(x,y)=e^x$:
$f_{xy}(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(f_x(x,y)) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(e^y) = e^y$
$f_{yx}(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(f_y(x,y)) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(e^x) = e^x$

**Answer:**

The equation

$$\left(\pdiff{y}{x}\right)
\left(\pdiff{z}{y}\right)
\left(\pdiff{x}{z}\right)=-1$$

expresses the relationship between the partial derivatives of the variables x, y, and z with respect to each other. In other words, it states that the product of the partial derivatives of y with respect to x and z with respect to y, is equal to -1.

To prove that this equation is true, we can use the following chain rule:

$$\pdiff{x}{z}=\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$$

This equation is derived from the following sequence of steps:

$$\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$$

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}=\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}$$

$$\Rightarrow \pdiff{x}{z}=\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=-1$$

Therefore, the equation

$$\left(\pdiff{y}{x}\right)
\left(\pdiff{z}{y}\right)
\left(\pdiff{x}{z}\right)=-1$$

is proven to be true.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The relationship between the partial derivatives of the variables x, y, and z with respect to each other is given by the equation

$$\left(\pdiff{y}{x}\right)
\left(\pdiff{z}{y}\right)
\left(\pdiff{x}{z}\right)=-1$$"," The model's explanation of the meaning of the equation is superficial and incomplete. It fails to mention the crucial context that the variables x, y, and z are interdependent, typically related by an implicit function F(x,y,z)=0, and that the partial derivatives imply certain variables are held constant (e.g., (∂y/∂x) implies z is held constant).

The proof provided by the model is fundamentally incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of multivariable calculus and the chain rule for partial derivatives.
1.  The model states ""we can use the following chain rule: $\pdiff{x}{z}=\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$"".

**Answer:**

The partial derivatives of $g(s,t) = f (s - t, s + t)$ with respect to $s$ and $t$ are given by

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial s}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(s-t,s+t)\frac{\partial s}{\partial s}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(s-t,s+t)\frac{\partial t}{\partial s}=f_x(s-t,s+t)  $$

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(s-t,s+t)\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(s-t,s+t)\frac{\partial t}{\partial t}=f_y(s-t,s+t)  $$

Taking the partial derivative of both sides of the above equations with respect to $s$ and $t$, respectively, we get

$$\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial s^2}=f_{xx}(s-t,s+t)+f_{xy}(s-t,s+t) \frac{\partial t}{\partial s}+f_{yy}(s-t,s+t) \frac{\partial t}{\partial s}=0$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial t^2}=f_{xx}(s-t,s+t) \frac{\partial s}{\partial t}+f_{xy}(s-t,s+t) \frac{\partial t}{\partial t}+f_{yy}(s-t,s+t)=0$$

Therefore, we have shown that

**Final Answer:**

$$\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial s^2}+\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial t^2}=0$$

for the composite function $g(s,t) = f (s - t, s + t)$, assuming that $f(x,y)$ is a smooth function that satisfies Laplace's equation."," The model's calculation of the first partial derivatives $\frac{\partial g}{\partial s}$ and $\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}$ is incorrect.
Let $x = s-t$ and $y = s+t$.
The chain rule states $\frac{\partial g}{\partial s} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}$.
Here, $\frac{\partial x}{\partial s} = 1$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial s} = 1$.
So, $\frac{\partial g}{\partial s} = f_x(s-t, s+t) \cdot 1 + f_y(s-t, s+t) \cdot 1 = f_x + f_y$.
The model incorrectly states $\frac{\partial g}{\partial s}=f_x(s-t,s+t)$, omitting the $f_y$ term and misapplying the chain rule.

Similarly, for $\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}$, the chain rule states $\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$.
Here, $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = -1$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 1$.
So, $\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = f_x(s-t, s+t) \cdot (-1) + f_y(s-t, s+t) \cdot 1 = -f_x + f_y$.
The model incorrectly states $\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}=f_y(s-t,s+t)$, omitting the $-f_x$ term and misapplying the chain rule.

Because the first partial derivatives are incorrect, the subsequent calculations for the second partial derivatives are also incorrect and nonsensical. The model also prematurely sets the second derivatives to zero without showing the detailed application of the chain rule that would lead to the desired result. The derivation is fundamentally flawed. ",False

**Solution:**

The derivative of $z$ with respect to time can be found using the chain rule as

$$\difftwo{}{t} z\big(x(t),y(t)\big) = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$

The partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ is given by

$$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = f_x (x, y) = f_x(2,1) = 5$$

The partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $y$ is given by

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = f_y (x, y) = f_y(2,1) = -2$$

The derivative of $x$ with respect to time is

$$\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{dx}{dt} = 4t$$

The derivative of $y$ with respect to time is

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{dy}{dt} = 3t^2$$

Substituting these values into the equation for the derivative of $z$ with respect to time, we get

$$\difftwo{}{t} z\big(x(t),y(t)\big) = 5(4t) - 2(3t^2) = 20t - 6t^2$$

Final Answer:

$$\difftwo{}{t} z\big(x(t),y(t)\big) = 20t - 6t^2$$"," The model's approach is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly assumes that $f_x(x(t), y(t))$ and $f_y(x(t), y(t))$ are constants equal to their values at $(2,1)$ for all $t$.

**Solution:**

The Implicit Function Theorem states that

$$\pdiff{z}{x} = - \frac{\partial f/\partial x}{\partial f/\partial z}$$

$$\pdiff{z}{y} = - \frac{\partial f/\partial y}{\partial f/\partial z}$$

Therefore, we have

$$x\pdiff{z}{x}+y\pdiff{z}{y} = -x\frac{\partial f/\partial x}{\partial f/\partial z}-y\frac{\partial f/\partial y}{\partial f/\partial z} = -z$$

Final Answer:

**-z =  x\pdiff{z}{x}+y\pdiff{z}{y}$$"," The model correctly applies the Implicit Function Theorem. Although its notation for the partial derivatives in the theorem statement (e.g., $\partial f/\partial x$) might be slightly ambiguous given that $f$ is initially defined as a function of $u$ and $v$, it correctly interprets these as the partial derivatives of the composite function $F(x,y,z) = f(xz,yz)$ with respect to $x, y,$ and $z$ (treating $z$ as an independent variable for the partial differentiation step).

Specifically, if we let $F(x,y,z) = f(xz,yz)$, then:
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \frac{\partial (xz)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} \frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial x} = f_u \cdot z + f_v \cdot 0 = z f_u$
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \frac{\partial (xz)}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} \frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial y} = f_u \cdot 0 + f_v \cdot z = z f_v$
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \frac{\partial (xz)}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} \frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial z} = f_u \cdot x + f_v \cdot y = x f_u + y f_v$

Substituting these into the Implicit Function Theorem formulas used by the model:
$\pdiff{z}{x} = - \frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial z} = - \frac{z f_u}{x f_u + y f_v}$
$\pdiff{z}{y} = - \frac{\partial F/\partial y}{\partial F/\partial z} = - \frac{z f_v}{x f_u + y f_v}$

These are the same expressions for $z_x$ and $z_y$ derived in the gold answer. The subsequent algebraic manipulation to show $x\pdiff{z}{x}+y\pdiff{z}{y} = -z$ is also correct and identical to the gold solution's final steps.

**Solution:**

The chain rule gives

$$w_s = \frac{\partial w}{\partial s} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}$$

$$w_t = \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$

Taking derivatives with respect to $s$ and $t$, we get

$$w_{ss} = \frac{\partial w_s}{\partial s} = \frac{\partial w_s}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial w_s}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}$$

$$w_{tt} = \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$

Since

$$u_{xy} = u_{yx}$$

$$\frac{\partial w_s}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial w_s}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} = u_x$$

$$\frac{\partial w_s}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial t} = u_t$$

$$w_{ss} = A u_x u_t$$

Think of $x=u^3-3uv^2$, $y=3u^2v-v^3$ as two equations in the two

    question implicitly tells us that those two equations can be solved
    for $u$, $v$ in terms of $x$, $y$, at least near
    $(u,v)=(2,1)$, $(x,y)=(2,11)$. That is, the question implicitly
    tells us that the functions $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are determined by
\begin{equation*}
x=u(x,y)^3-3u(x,y)\,v(x,y)^2\qquad
y=3u(x,y)^2v(x,y)-v(x,y)^3

Applying $\pdiff{}{x}$ to both sides of the equation
$x=u(x,y)^3-3u(x,y)v(x,y)^2$ gives

**Answer:**

The function $w$ is defined by

$$w(x,y)=e^{-y}f(x-y)$$

where $f$ is an arbitrary differentiable function. We can see that

$$\pdiff{w}{x}=e^{-y}f'(x-y)$$

$$\pdiff{w}{y}=-e^{-y}f(x-y)$$

Therefore,

$$w+\pdiff{w}{x}+\pdiff{w}{y}=e^{-y}f(x-y)+e^{-y}f'(x-y)-e^{-y}f(x-y)=0$$

This shows that $w$ satisfies the partial differential equation.

For the second part, we have the equations

$$x=u^3-3uv^2$$

$$y=3u^2v-v^3$$

$$z=u^2-v^2$$

We can find the partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ using the chain rule as

$$\pdiff{z}{x}=\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$

We have

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}=2u$$

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial v}=-2v$$

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=3u^2$$

$$\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=-3uv^2$$

Substituting these values into the equation for $\pdiff{z}{x}$, we get

$$\pdiff{z}{x}=6u^2-6uv^2=0$$

Therefore,

**Final Answer:**

$$\pdiff{z}{x}=0 \text{ at }(x,y)=(2,11)$$","
The model's solution for both parts (a) and (b) is incorrect.

**Part (a):**
The model incorrectly calculates $\pdiff{w}{y}$.
The correct partial derivative $\pdiff{w}{y}$ by the product rule and chain rule is:
$\pdiff{w}{y} = \pdiff{}{y}(e^{-y})f(x-y) + e^{-y}\pdiff{}{y}(f(x-y))$
$= -e^{-y}f(x-y) + e^{-y}f'(x-y)\pdiff{}{y}(x-y)$
$= -e^{-y}f(x-y) + e^{-y}f'(x-y)(-1)$
$= -e^{-y}f(x-y) - e^{-y}f'(x-y)$

The model only has $\pdiff{w}{y}=-e^{-y}f(x-y)$, missing the second term $-e^{-y}f'(x-y)$.
As a result, the sum $w+\pdiff{w}{x}+\pdiff{w}{y}$ as calculated by the model is:
$e^{-y}f(x-y) + e^{-y}f'(x-y) + (-e^{-y}f(x-y)) = e^{-y}f'(x-y)$
The model then incorrectly states this equals 0. The correct sum, using the accurate $\pdiff{w}{y}$, is 0.

**Part (b):**
The model fundamentally misunderstands how to find $\pdiff{u}{x}$ and $\pdiff{v}{x}$. It states $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=3u^2$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=-3uv^2$. These are not correct. To find $\pdiff{u}{x}$ and $\pdiff{v}{x}$, one must use implicit differentiation on the given equations $x=u^3-3uv^2$ and $y=3u^2v-v^3$. This involves differentiating both equations with respect to $x$ (treating $u$ and $v$ as functions of $x$ and $y$) and then solving the resulting system of linear equations for $\pdiff{u}{x}$ and $\pdiff{v}{x}$.

The subsequent calculation steps after incorrectly determining $\pdiff{u}{x}$ and $\pdiff{v}{x}$ are also flawed. The model states $\pdiff{z}{x}=6u^2-6uv^2=0$, which is inconsistent with its preceding statements and the actual expression for $\pdiff{z}{x}$ using its incorrect terms ($2u(3u^2) + (-2v)(-3uv^2) = 6u^3 + 6uv^3$). The final answer of $\pdiff{z}{x}=0$ is incorrect.
The gold answer correctly finds $\pdiff{u}{x} = \frac{1}{25}$ and $\pdiff{v}{x} = -\frac{4}{75}$, leading to $\pdiff{z}{x} = \frac{4}{15}$.

at $P$ contains the origin $(0,0,0)$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The equation of $S$ is of the form $G(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y-z = 1$.
So one normal vector to $S$ at the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is 
\begin{equation*}
\vnabla G(x_0,y_0,z_0)  = 2x_0\,\hi + (4y_0+2)\,\hj -\hk

(x,y,z) = (x_0,y_0,z_0) +t\llt 2x_0\,,\,4y_0+2\,,\, -1\rgt

\begin{align*}
(0,0,0) = (x_0,y_0,z_0) +t\llt 2x_0\,,\,4y_0+2\,,\, -1\rgt
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
x_0 + 2x_0\,t & =0 \tag{E1}\\
y_0 +(4y_0+2)t &=0 \tag{E2}\\
z_0 -t &=0 \tag{E3}
\end{align*}
Equation (E3) forces $t=z_0$. Substituting this into equations (E1) and (E2)
gives
\begin{align*}
x_0(1+2z_0) & =0 \tag{E1}\\
y_0 +(4y_0+2)z_0 &=0 \tag{E2}

The question specifies that $x_0\ne 0$, so (E1) forces $z_0=-\frac{1}{2}$.
Substituting $z_0=-\frac{1}{2}$ into (E2) gives
\begin{equation*}
-y_0-1=0 \implies y_0=-1
\end{equation*}
Finally $x_0$ is determined by the requirement that $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$
must lie on $S$ and so must obey
\begin{equation*}
z_0 = x_0^2 + 2y_0^2 + 2y_0 - 1
\implies -\frac{1}{2} = x_0^2 + 2(-1)^2 +2(-1)-1
\implies x_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}

and 
  $\big(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,-1\,,\,-\frac{1}{2}\big)$.
\end{solution}",Partial Derivatves,CLP3,"

**Solution:**

The normal line to a surface at a point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is given by the equation:

$$\vec{r}(t) = \langle x_0 + t, y_0 + t, z_0 + t \rangle$$

where $\vec{r}(t)$ is the position vector of the line.

In order for the normal line to contain the origin, we must have:

$$x_0 = y_0 = z_0 = 0$$

Substituting these values into the equation of the surface, we get:

$$2y^2 + 2y - 1 = 0$$

Solving this equation for $y$, we get:

$$y = 0 \text{ or } y = \pm \sqrt{-1}$$

Since $y_0 \ne 0$, we take the positive square root:

$$y_0 = \sqrt{-1}$$

Now that we know $x_0, y_0$, and $z_0$, we can find the point $P (x_0,y_0,z_0)$ on the surface that satisfies the condition:

**Final Answer:**

The point $P (x_0,y_0,z_0)$ on the surface $S$ with $x_0 \ne 0$ such that the normal line at $P$ contains the origin is given by:

$$P (\sqrt{-1}, \sqrt{-1}, -1)$$"," The model's approach to finding the normal line is fundamentally incorrect.
1.  **Incorrect Normal Line Equation**: The model states ""The normal line to a surface at a point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is given by the equation: $\vec{r}(t) = \langle x_0 + t, y_0 + t, z_0 + t \rangle$"". This is wrong. The direction vector of the normal line should be the gradient of the surface $G(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y - z - 1 = 0$, which is $\nabla G = \langle 2x, 4y+2, -1 \rangle$. The correct normal line equation is $(x,y,z) = (x_0,y_0,z_0) + t \langle 2x_0, 4y_0+2, -1 \rangle$.
2.  **Incorrect Condition for Origin**: The model states ""In order for the normal line to contain the origin, we must have: $x_0 = y_0 = z_0 = 0$"". This is incorrect. This statement implies the point $P$ itself is the origin, which is not what ""the normal line at P contains the origin"" means. The origin simply needs to be a point on the line. Furthermore, if $P=(0,0,0)$, then $0 = 0^2 + 2(0)^2 + 2(0) - 1$, which simplifies to $0 = -1$, a contradiction. So the origin is not on the surface $S$.
3.  **Incorrect Algebraic Steps**: The model attempts to solve $2y^2 + 2y - 1 = 0$ and incorrectly derives $y=0$ or $y=\pm\sqrt{-1}$. The correct solutions for $2y^2 + 2y - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula are $y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{12}}{4} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2}$.
4.  **Imaginary Results**: The final answer contains imaginary numbers ($x_0 = \sqrt{-1}$, $y_0 = \sqrt{-1}$), which are not expected for this type of problem and do not match the real-valued coordinates in the gold answer.
5.  **Failure to Use $x_0 \ne 0$**: The model does not correctly incorporate the condition $x_0 \ne 0$ into its solution process.

**Answer:**

The given partial differential equation is

Part (a) of the model's answer is correct. If $u_x = 0$, then $u(x,y)$ does not depend on $x$, so $u(x,y) = g(y)$ for some arbitrary function $g(y)$.

Part (b) of the model's answer is incorrect. The partial differential equation is $u_x(x,y) = f(x)$. To find $u(x,y)$, one must integrate $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a constant.

The model incorrectly states $u(x,y) = f(x) + g(y)$. If $u(x,y) = f(x) + g(y)$, then $u_x(x,y) = f'(x)$, which would imply $f'(x) = f(x)$, which is not generally true for an arbitrary given function $f(x)$.

**Answer:**

The gradient vector of $w = f(x,y,z)$ at $P$ is given by

$$\vec{\nabla} w(P) = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \mathbf{k}$$

where

$$\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(P), \quad \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(P), \quad \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(P)$$

Since the directional derivative of $w$ at $P$ is a maximum in the direction of the vector $2\hi - \hj + \hk$, the gradient vector of $w$ at $P$ must be parallel to this vector. Therefore, we have

$$\vec{\nabla} w(P) = 3\sqrt{6}(2\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k})$$

The directional derivative of $w = f(x,y,z)$ at $P$ in the direction of the vector $\hi + \hj$ is given by

$$D_w(\vec{u}) = \vec{\nabla} w(P) \cdot \frac{\vec{u}}{\sqrt{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}}}=3\sqrt{6}$$

Final Answer:

**Final Answer:** The directional derivative of $w = f(x,y,z)$ at $P$ in the direction of the vector $\hi + \hj$ is $3\sqrt{6}$.","
The model's final answer for part (b) is incorrect.

1.  **Part (a) - Gradient Vector:** The model correctly identifies that the gradient vector is parallel to the direction of maximum increase. However, it incorrectly calculates the gradient vector. The magnitude of the gradient vector is $3\sqrt{6}$, and the direction vector is $2\hi - \hj + \hk$. To find the gradient vector, one must normalize the direction vector before scaling it by the magnitude.
    *   Magnitude of direction vector: $|2\hi - \hj + \hk| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4+1+1} = \sqrt{6}$.
    *   The correct gradient vector should be $\vec{\nabla} w(P) = 3\sqrt{6} \frac{2\hi - \hj + \hk}{\sqrt{6}} = 3(2\hi - \hj + \hk) = 6\hi - 3\hj + 3\hk$.
    *   The model calculates $\vec{\nabla} w(P) = 3\sqrt{6}(2\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k})$, which is $6\sqrt{6}\mathbf{i} - 3\sqrt{6}\mathbf{j} + 3\sqrt{6}\mathbf{k}$. This is incorrect.

2.  **Part (b) - Directional Derivative:** The model states the directional derivative in the direction of $\hi + \hj$ is $3\sqrt{6}$. This is incorrect. $3\sqrt{6}$ is the maximum value of the directional derivative (the magnitude of the gradient), not the directional derivative in an arbitrary direction like $\hi + \hj$. The directional derivative must be calculated using the dot product of the gradient vector and the unit vector in the specified direction.
    *   Using the *correct* gradient from the gold answer: $\vec{\nabla} w(P) = 6\hi - 3\hj + 3\hk$.
    *   Unit vector for $\hi + \hj$: $\frac{\hi + \hj}{|\hi + \hj|} = \frac{\hi + \hj}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{\hi + \hj}{\sqrt{2}}$.
    *   Directional derivative = $(6\hi - 3\hj + 3\hk) \cdot \frac{\hi + \hj}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(6 \cdot 1 + (-3) \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(6-3) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}$.
    *   The model's final answer $3\sqrt{6}$ is numerically different from the correct answer $\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}$.

**Solution:**

The gradient of the temperature function is given by

$$\vec{\nabla} T = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \mathbf{k} = (4x) \mathbf{i} + (2y) \mathbf{j} - (2z) \mathbf{k}$$

In order to stay at a constant temperature, the mosquito must fly in a direction opposite to the gradient of the temperature function at her current position. This will ensure that the rate of change of temperature in that direction is $0$.

Final Answer: The mosquito should fly in the direction

$$\mathbf{r}_T = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{i} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{j} - \mathbf{k}$$"," The model correctly calculates the general gradient $\nabla T$. However, it makes a fundamental error in interpreting the condition for part (a). To stay at the same temperature (i.e., for the initial rate of change of temperature to be 0), the mosquito must fly in a direction **perpendicular** to the temperature gradient, not opposite to it. Flying opposite to the gradient leads to the fastest *decrease* in temperature.

The specific ""Final Answer"" direction given by the model, $\mathbf{r}_T = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{i} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{j} - \mathbf{k}$, does not satisfy the condition for part (a) at the point $(3,2,1)$. The gradient at $(3,2,1)$ is $\nabla T(3,2,1) = \langle 4(3), 2(2), -2(1) \rangle = \langle 12, 4, -2 \rangle$. The dot product of this gradient with the model's direction is $12(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) + 4(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) - 2(-1) = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} + 2 = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} + 2 = 4\sqrt{2} + 2$, which is not zero.

Use Lagrange multipliers to find the points on the sphere
$z^2 + x^2 + y^2 - 2y - 10 = 0$ closest to and farthest from the point 
$(1, -2, 1)$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The function $f(x,y,z)=(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2+(z-1)^2$ gives the square of 
the distance from  the point $(x,y,z)$ to the point $(1,-2,1)$. 
So it suffices to find the $(x,y,z)$ which minimizes $
f(x,y,z)=(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2+(z-1)^2$ subject 
to the constraint $g(x,y,z) = z^2 + x^2 + y^2 - 2y - 10=0$.
By Theorem \eref{CLP200}{thm Lagrange} in the CLP-3 text, any local minimum

Substituting these into (E4), and using that 
\begin{equation*}
y-2=-\frac{2+\la}{1-\la} -\frac{2-2\la}{1-\la}=-\frac{4-\la}{1-\la}

**Solution:**

The problem is to find the points on the sphere

$$z^2 + x^2 + y^2 - 2y - 10 = 0$$

closest to and farthest from the point

$$(1, -2, 1)$$

Using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the following function:

$$\ell = f(x, y, z) = (x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 - 2y - 10$$

Taking the partial derivatives and setting them equal to 0, we get the following system of equations:

$$\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial x} = 2(x - 1) = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial y} = 2(y + 2) - 2 = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial z} = 2(z - 1) = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \lambda} = \lambda = 0$$

Solving this system of equations, we find the following critical points:

$$(\sqrt{3}, -2, 1) \text{ and } (-\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$$

Taking the distance of each critical point from the point $(1, -2, 1)$ using the distance formula, we find the closest point is

$$(\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$$

$$(-\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$$

$$(\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$$

and

$$(-\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$$"," The model's application of the Lagrange multiplier method is fundamentally incorrect from the outset.
1.  **Incorrect Lagrangian Setup:** The model defines $\ell = f(x, y, z) = (x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 - 2y - 10$. This is not a proper Lagrangian for the problem. The correct Lagrangian should be $L(x,y,z,\lambda) = f(x,y,z) - \lambda g(x,y,z)$, where $f$ is the objective function and $g$ is the constraint function. The model incorrectly subtracts only a part of the constraint function and does not introduce the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ correctly into its partial derivative equations.
2.  **Incorrect Partial Derivatives:** Based on its incorrect $\ell$ function, the partial derivatives the model sets up lead to $x=1, y=-1, z=1$.
3.  **Inconsistent Results:** The model then states ""Solving this system of equations, we find the following critical points: $(\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$ and $(-\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$"". These points are not the result of solving the partial derivative equations it presented ($x=1, y=-1, z=1$). This shows a clear inconsistency or hallucination in the model's reasoning.
4.  **Points Not on the Sphere:** Neither the points derived from the model's own (incorrect) equations ($ (1, -1, 1) $) nor the ""critical points"" it states ($ (\sqrt{3}, -2, 1) $ and $ (-\sqrt{3}, -2, 1) $) satisfy the given constraint equation $z^2 + x^2 + y^2 - 2y - 10 = 0$. For instance, for $(\sqrt{3}, -2, 1)$, we have $1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 + (-2)^2 - 2(-2) - 10 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 - 10 = 2 \neq 0$. For $(1, -1, 1)$, we have $1^2+1^2+(-1)^2-2(-1)-10 = 1+1+1+2-10 = -5 \neq 0$. Since these points are not on the sphere, they cannot be the closest or farthest points on the sphere.

**Solution:**

The given ellipse is

$$2x^2 + 4xy + 5y^2 = 30$$

We know that the points on an ellipse are given by the parametric equation

$$x = a\cos\omega$$

$$y = b\sin\omega$$

where $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively, and $\omega$ is the parameter.

To find the points closest and farthest from the origin, we need to find the values of $\omega$ that minimize and maximize the distance from the origin to the point $(x, y)$ given by the parametric equation.

The distance from a point to the origin is given by the formula

$$d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

Substituting the parametric equation for $x$ and $y$ into this formula, we get

$$d = \sqrt{(a\cos\omega)^2 + (b\sin\omega)^2}$$

To minimize and maximize this distance, we need to find the derivative of $d$ with respect to $\omega$ and set it equal to 0. After doing this, we find that the minimum distance is

$$d_min = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

and the maximum distance is

$$d_max = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \sqrt{2}$$

Final Answer: The points on the ellipse $2x^2 + 4xy + 5y^2 = 30$ which are closest to and farthest from the origin are

		\item Since $w_1$ has the highest frequency, $w_2$ has the next-highest frequency, and so on, we know $f_1$ is larger than the other members of its sequence, $f_2$ is the next largest, etc. So, $\{f_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence.
		\item The most-used word in a language is $w_1$, while the $n$-th most used word in a language is $w_n$. So, we re-state the law as:
		\[f_1=nf_n\] Then we can rewrite this fomula a little more naturally as $f_n=\frac{1}{n}f_1$.
		\item Then $f_3=\frac{1}{3}f_1$. In this case, we expect the third-most used word to account for  $\frac{1}{3}(6\%) = 2\%$ of all words.
		\item From (b), we know $f_{10}=\frac{1}{10}f_1$. Note $f_1=6f_6=6(0.3\%)$. Then:
		\[f_{10}=\frac{1}{10}f_1 = \frac{1}{10}6f_6=\frac{1}{10}(6)(0.3\%)=\frac{1.8}{10}\%=0.18\%\]
		So, $f_{10}$ should be 0.18\% of all words.
		\item The use of the word ``frequency"" in the statement of Zipf's law implies $f_n = \frac{\text{uses of $w_n$}}{\text{total number of words}}$. The question asks for the total uses of $w_n$. If we call this quantity $t_n$, and the total number of all words is $T$, then Zipf's law tells us $\frac{t_n}{T}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{t_1}{T}$, hence $t_n=\frac{1}{n}t_1$.

		With this notation, the problem states $t_1=22,038,615$, $w_1=\texttt{the}$, $w_2=\texttt{be}$, and  $w_3=\texttt{and}$.

		Following Zipf's law, $t_n=\frac1nt_1$. So, we expect $t_2=\frac{t_1}{2} = 11,019,307.5$; since this isn't an integer, let's say we expect $t_2\approx 11,019,308$. Similarly, we expect
		$t_3=\frac{t_1}{3} = 7,346,205$.

		Remark: The 450-million-word source material that used ``the"" 22,038,615 times also contained 12,545,825 instances of ``be,"" and 10,741,073 instances of ``and."" While Zipf's Law might be a nice model for our data overall, in these few instances it does not appear to be extremely accurate.
	%	\item Using Mandelbrot's formula, we would predict $f_2=\frac{f_1}{2+2.7}\approx 4,689,067$ and
	%	$f_3=\frac{f_1}{3+2.7}\approx 3,866,424$. Both Zipf and Mandelbrot predict frequencies of ``be"" and ``and"" that are smaller than the actual usage in our sample, but Mandelbrot's prediction is \emph{even smaller than} Zipf's. So, we might reasonably say that Zipf's law fits better in this case.

	%	That being said, there are many ways we could determine which law fits the data better. Ideally, we'd use more than three words. Even with only the first three words, we can still conduct a deeper investigation.

	%	Let's think about the work in part (d). Instead of using the observed frequency $f_1$ to predict $f_2$ and $f_3$, we could use the observed frequency  $f_2$ or $f_3$ to predict the others.

	%			\item Using Mandelbrot's formula, we predict $f_1=4.7f_2$ and $f_3=\frac{4.7 }{5.7}f_2$. This leads to the predictions $f_1\approx 58,965,377$ and $f_3\approx 10,344,803$

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n\cdot n!} x^n$$

$$f'(x) = \frac{1-e^{-x}}{x}$$

$$f''(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{x}$$

$$f'''(x) = \frac{-e^{-x}}{x}$$

The Maclaurin series is then found using the formula

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n$$

where $f^{(n)}(0)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $x = 0.

The series converges for all $x$, as the ratio test shows that

$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right| = 0$$

The model fails to properly address both parts of the question.

For part (a), the question asks to ""Show that the Maclaurin series for $f(x)$ is..."". The model merely restates the given series as the answer, which is not a derivation or a proof. Furthermore, its attempt to use derivatives to find the Maclaurin series coefficients is flawed, as it calculates incorrect higher-order derivatives ($f''(x)$ and $f'''(x)$ are wrong). It does not follow through with this method to derive the series.

For part (b), the question asks to ""Use the ratio test to determine the values of $x$ for which the Maclaurin series converges."" The model states the correct conclusion (converges for all $x$) and the correct limit for the ratio test (0). However, it does not show any of the steps involved in applying the ratio test, i.e., setting up the ratio $|a_{n+1}/a_n|$ and simplifying it. Without these steps, the model has not ""used"" the ratio test; it has only stated its outcome.

**Solution:**

The Maclaurin series is given by

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty b_nx^n = \frac{f(0)}{n!} + \frac{f'(0)}{n!}x + \frac{f''(0)}{2n!}x^2$$

where $f(0)$ is the value of $f(x)$ at $x = 0, $f'(0)$ is the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ at $x = 0, and $f''(0)$ is the second derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ at $x = 0.

In this case, we have

$$f(0) = \frac{3}{1} - \frac{1}{2} = 2$$

$$f'(0) = \frac{-3}{1} = -3$$

$$f''(0) = \frac{6}{1} = 6$$

Substituting these values into the equation for the Maclaurin series, we get

$$b_n = \frac{2}{n!} - \frac{3}{n!}x + \frac{6}{2n!}x^2$$

Final Answer:

**The coefficient of the Maclaurin series for the function  $$f(x) = \frac{3}{x+1} - \frac{1}{2x-1}$$  is given by

	Define the hyperbolic sine function as
	\[\sinh x = \frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}.\]
	Suppose you wanted to approximate the number $\sinh(b)$ using the Maclaurin series of $\sinh x$, where $b$ is some number in $(-2,1)$. Which partial sum should you use to guarantee 10 decimal places of accuracy?
	(That is, an absolute error less than $5\times10^{-11}$.)

	You may assume without proof that $2<e<3$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
	We'll use  Theorem~\eref{CLP101}{eq:TaylorPolyPlusError_b} in the CLP-2 text to bound the error of a partial-sum approximation. The error in the partial-sum approximation $S_N$ is
	\[E_N=\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}\]
	for some $c$ strictly between $a$ and $x$. In our case, $a=0$ and $x$ is in $(-2,1)$. So, we want to find a value of $N$ such that
	\[\left|\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}\left(x\right)^{N+1}\right|<5\times 10^{-11}\]
	for \emph{all} $x$ in $(-2,1)$, and \emph{all} $c$ in $(-2,1)$.

	To find this $N$, we to know $f^{(N+1)}(x)$. Just like when we create a Taylor polynomial from scratch, we'll differentiate $f(x)$ several times, and look for a pattern.

\begin{align*}
f(x)=\sinh(x)&=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\
f'(x)&=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}\\
f''(x)&=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\
f'''(x)&=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}
\end{align*}
That is, even derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f(x)$, and odd derivatives of $f(x)$ are $\frac{{e^x}+e^{-x}}{2}$ (which, incidentally, is the function called $\cosh x$).

	Now we want a reasonable bound on $f^{(N+1)}(c)$, when $c$ is in $(-2,1)$. Since powers of $e$ are always positive, we begin by noting that $0<\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}<\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$. So, all derivatives of $f(x)$ are bounded above by $\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$.
	\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&&-2 &<c<1\\
	&\Rightarrow&\qquad e^{-2} &<e^c<e &\mbox{and } e^{-1}&<e^{-c}<e^2\\
	&\Rightarrow&\qquad f^{(N+1)}(c)&<\frac{e^c+e^{-c}}{2} & &<\frac{e^2+e^2}{2}=e^2<9
	\end{alignat*}

	This bound provides us with a ``worst-case scenario"" error. We don't know exactly what $c$ is, but we don't need to--the bound above holds for \emph{all} $c$ between $-2$ and $1$.

	We also don't know exactly what $x$ will be, only that it's between $-2$ and $1$. So, we note $|x|^{N+1}<2^{N+1}$.

	Now we're ready to choose an $N$ that results in a sufficiently small error bound.

	\begin{align*}
	\left|\frac{\textcolor{blue}{f^{(N+1)}(c)}}{(N+1)!}\textcolor{red}{\left(x\right)^{N+1}}\right|&<
	\frac{\textcolor{blue}{9}\cdot \textcolor{red}{2^{N+1}}}{(N+1)!}\\
	\text{So, we want:}\qquad \frac{9\cdot2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}&<5\times 10^{-11}
	\end{align*}

	To find an appropriate $N$, we test several values.

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			\hline
			$N$&$ \dfrac{9\cdot 2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}$\\ \hline
			10 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{11}}{(11)!}\approx 5\times 10^{-4}$\\\hline
			15 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{16}}{(16)!}\approx 3\times 10^{-8}$\\\hline
			17 & $\displaystyle \frac{9\cdot 2^{18}}{(18)!}\approx 4\times 10^{-10}$\\\hline

	So, it suffices to use the partial sum $S_{18}$.
\end{solution}",Sequences and Series,CLP2,"

**Solution:**

The Maclaurin series for the hyperbolic sine function is given by

$$\sinh x = x + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \cdots$$

To approximate $\sinh(b)$ with a Maclaurin series, we need to find the number of terms that will guarantee a given accuracy. The error of the Maclaurin series is bounded by

$$\error = \frac{M_n}{n!} \times x^n$$

where $M_n$ is the magnitude of the next term in the series and $n$ is the number of terms used in the approximation.

To guarantee 10 decimal places of accuracy, we need to find the value of $n$ such that

$$\frac{M_n}{n!} \times b^n < 5\times10^{-11}$$

where $M_n$ is the magnitude of the next term in the series. Since

$$M_n = \frac{b^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$

this inequality becomes

$$\frac{b^{2n+1}}{n!} \times b^n < 5\times10^{-11}$$

Solving this inequality for $n$, we find that $n=5$ is the required number of terms.

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: To approximate $\sinh(b)$ with 10 decimal places of accuracy, a partial sum of the Maclaurin series with $n=5$ terms is required."," The model's final answer of $n=5$ terms (which corresponds to the partial sum $S_9(x)$ including terms up to $x^9$) is incorrect. The gold answer correctly determines that the partial sum $S_{18}(x)$ is required, which includes terms up to $x^{17}$ (9 non-zero terms).

The model's methodology for calculating the error bound is fundamentally flawed:
1.  The formula ""$\error = \frac{M_n}{n!} \times x^n$"" is not the standard Taylor Remainder Theorem. The standard form is $R_N(x) = \frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!} (x-a)^{N+1}$.
2.  The definition ""$M_n = \frac{b^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$"" is incorrect for $M_n$ in an error bound. This term appears to be a general term of the series, not a bound on the $(N+1)$-th derivative.
3.  Substituting this $M_n$ into its own incorrect error formula leads to $\frac{b^{3n+1}}{(2n+1)! n!} < 5\times10^{-11}$. Even if we use this incorrect inequality, testing $n=5$ with the worst-case $b=2$ gives $\frac{2^{16}}{11!5!} \approx 1.36 \times 10^{-5}$, which is much larger than $5 \times 10^{-11}$. Therefore, the model's calculation of $n=5$ is incorrect even based on its own flawed formula.

The correct approach, as demonstrated by the gold answer, uses Taylor's Remainder Theorem:
$|E_N(x)| = \left|\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}x^{N+1}\right|$.
For $f(x) = \sinh x$, $f^{(N+1)}(x)$ is either $\sinh x$ or $\cosh x$. For $c \in (-2,1)$, $|\sinh c| \le \cosh c$. The maximum value of $\cosh c$ for $c \in (-2,1)$ is less than $\cosh(2) = \frac{e^2+e^{-2}}{2} < \frac{e^2+1}{2} < \frac{9+1}{2}=5$. The gold answer uses a slightly looser but valid bound of $e^2 < 9$.
The maximum value of $|x|^{N+1}$ for $x \in (-2,1)$ is $2^{N+1}$.
So, $|E_N(x)| < \frac{9 \cdot 2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}$.
To guarantee the accuracy, we need $\frac{9 \cdot 2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!} < 5 \times 10^{-11}$.
Checking values (as in the gold answer):
For $N=17$, $\frac{9 \cdot 2^{18}}{18!} \approx 4 \times 10^{-10}$.
For $N=18$, $\frac{9 \cdot 2^{19}}{19!} \approx 4 \times 10^{-11}$.
Thus, $N=18$ is the correct degree of the partial sum. This means using $S_{18}(x)$, which includes terms up to $x^{17}$. ",False

We know that the Taylor series for $\arctan x$ is $\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$, which converges for $-1\le x\le1$. So, the Taylor series for $\arctan(x^3)$ is

(Notice, after ten differentiations, the terms $a_0$ and $a_1$ are both zero.)

Since this is an alternating series, the absolute error involved in using the approximation $S_N$ is at most
\[|a_{N+1}|=\frac{(6N+9)!}{(2N+3)(6N-1)!\cdot 5^{6N-1}}\]
By testing a few values of $N$, we find
\[|a_6|=|a_{5+1}|=\frac{39!}{(13)(29!)\cdot 5^{29}}\approx 0.00000095<10^{-6}\]
So, $S_5$ is a sufficient approximation. That is,

**Solution:**

The Maclaurin series for arctangent is given by

$$f(x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \tan(x)$$

The derivative of $f(x)$ is

$$f'(x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \sec^2(x)$$

Using this series, we can write

$$f^{(10)}\left(\frac{1}{5} \right)= \sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \tan\left(\frac{1}{5} \right)$$

This series converges rapidly, so we can stop at $n=10 to get an error less than $10^{-6}$.

**Final Answer:**

$$f^{(10)}\left(\frac{1}{5} \right)= \sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \tan\left(\frac{1}{5} \right) \approx 0.265$$"," The model makes several fundamental errors:
1.  **Incorrect Maclaurin Series for Arctangent:** The model states $f(x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \tan(x)$. The correct Maclaurin series for $\arctan(x)$ is $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} x^{2n+1}$. The inclusion of $\tan(x)$ within the summation is completely wrong and demonstrates a misunderstanding of power series.
2.  **Incorrect Differentiation:** Based on its incorrect series, the model attempts to differentiate, leading to $f'(x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \sec^2(x)$. This is also incorrect as it improperly differentiates a term that should be a power of $x$, not $\tan(x)$.
3.  **Incorrect Form for the 10th Derivative:** The model's expression $f^{(10)}\left(\frac{1}{5} \right)= \sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \tan\left(\frac{1}{5} \right)$ bears no resemblance to the 10th derivative of the given function. It appears to have just replaced $x$ with $1/5$ in its initial incorrect series and then claimed it as the 10th derivative.

\end{question}","\begin{solution} (a)
\begin{description}
\item[Solution 1:]
We need to show that
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges.
If we replace $n$ by $x$ in the summand, we get $f(x) = 24x^2 e^{-x^3}$,
which we can integate. (Just substitute $u=x^3$.)
So let's try the integral test.
First, we have to check that $f(x)$ is positive and decreasing.
It is certainly positive. To determine if it is decreasing, we compute
\begin{align*}
\diff{f}{x} = 48x e^{-x^3} - 24\times 3 x^4 e^{-x^3}
= 24x (2-3x^3) e^{-x^3}
\end{align*}
which is negative for $x\ge1$. Therefore $f(x)$ is decreasing for $x\ge1$,
and the integral test applies. The substitution $u=x^3$,
$\dee{u}=3x^2\,\,\dee{x}$, yields
\begin{align*}
\int f(x) \,\dee{x}
= \int 24x^2 e^{-x^3} \,\dee{x} = \int 8 e^{-u}\,\dee{u} = -8e^{-u} + C = -8e^{-x^3} + C.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\int_1^\infty f(x) \,\dee{x} &= \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_1^R f(x) \,\dee{x}
  = \lim_{R \to \infty} \bigg[{-}8 e^{-x^3} \bigg]_1^R  \\
   &= \lim_{R \to \infty} ( - 8 e^{-R^3} + 8 e^{-1}  ) = 8 e^{-1}
\end{align*}
Since the integral is convergent, the series
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges
and the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$
converges absolutely.

\item[Solution 2:]
Alternatively, we can use the ratio test with $a_n=24n^2 e^{-n^3}$.
We calculate
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{24 (n+1)^2e^{-(n+1)^3}}{24 n^2e^{-n^3}} \right| \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( \frac{(n+1)^2}{n^2} \frac{e^{n^3}}{e^{(n+1)^3}} \right) \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 e^{-(3n^2+3n+1)} = 1\cdot0=0 < 1,
\end{align*}
and therefore the series converges absolutely.

\item[Solution 3:]
Alternatively, alternatively, we can use the limiting comparison test.
First a little intuition building. Recall that we need to show that
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges. The $n^{\rm th}$
term in this series is
\begin{equation*}
a_n = 24n^2 e^{-n^3} =\frac{24 n^2}{e^{n^3}}
\end{equation*}
It is a ratio with both the numerator and denominator growing with $n$.
A good rule of thumb is that exponentials grow a lot faster than powers.
For example, if $n=10$ the numerator is $2400=2.4\times 10^3$
and the denominator is about $2\times 10^{434}$.
So we would guess that $a_n$ tends to zero as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
The question is ``does $a_n$ tend to zero fast enough with $n$ that our series converges?''. For example, we know that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$
converges (by the $p$--test with $p=2$). So if $a_n$ tends to zero faster
than $\frac{1}{n^2}$ does, our series will converge. So let's try the limiting convergence test with $a_n = 24n^2 e^{-n^3} =\frac{24 n^2}{e^{n^3}}$
and $b_n=\frac{1}{n^2}$.
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{24n^2 e^{-n^3}}{1/n^2}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{24n^4 }{e^{n^3}}
\end{align*}
By l'H\^opital's rule, twice,
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{24x^4 }{e^{x^3}}
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{4\times 24x^3 }{3 x^2e^{x^3}}
&\text{by l'H\^opital} \\
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{32x }{e^{x^3}}
&\text{just cleaning up} \\
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{32 }{3x^2e^{x^3}}
&\text{by l'H\^opital, again} \\
&=0
\end{align*}
That's it. The limit comparison test now tells us that
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges.

\end{description}

\noindent (b)
In part (a) we saw that $24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ is positive and decreasing.
The limit of this sequence equals $0$ (as can be shown with l'H\^opital's
Rule, just as we did at the end of the third solution of part (a)). Therefore, we can
use the alternating series test, so that the
error made in approximating the infinite sum
$S= \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_n
= \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty  (-1)^{n-1} 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ by the sum of its first $N$ terms,
$S_N=\sum\limits_{n=1}^N a_n$,  lies between $0$
and the first omitted term, $a_{N+1}$.
If we use $5$ terms, the error satisfies
\begin{align*}
   |S - S_5 | \le |a_6| = 24 \times 36 e^{-6^3}\approx 1.3 \times 10^{-91}
\end{align*}



\end{solution}",Sequences and Series,CLP2,"

**Solution:**

The series $S$ is given by

$$S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$$

(a) The series $S$ converges absolutely because

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left| (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3} \right| = \sum_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$$

is convergent by the Alternating Series Test and the Comparison Test.

(b) The fifth partial sum $S_5$ is given by

$$S_5 = \sum_{n=1}^5 (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$$

The error resulting from this approximation is bounded by

$$\varepsilon = S - S_5 = \sum_{n=6}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$$

$$\varepsilon \leq \sum_{n=6}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3} \leq \int_5^\infty 24x^2 e^{-x^3} dx = \frac{1}{3} e^{-25} \approx 0.00001$$

Final Answer: The series $S$ converges absolutely, and the error resulting from approximating $S$ by its fifth partial sum $S_5$ is bounded by $\varepsilon \leq 0.00001$.","
The model's answer is incorrect for both parts of the question.

**Part (a):**
The model states that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges by the Alternating Series Test and the Comparison Test.
1.  The Alternating Series Test (AST) is used to determine the convergence of *alternating* series, not series with positive terms. The series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ consists of positive terms, so AST cannot be applied here. This is a fundamental error.
2.  While the Comparison Test (or Limit Comparison Test) *could* be used, the model merely states ""by... the Comparison Test"" without providing any comparison series or showing the steps of the test. For a ""show that"" question, this is insufficient and incomplete.
The gold answer provides multiple valid methods (Integral Test, Ratio Test, Limit Comparison Test), all of which require detailed steps and justification, none of which are present or correctly applied in the model's answer.

**Part (b):**
The model identifies the error as $\varepsilon = S - S_5 = \sum_{n=6}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$. This is correct for the error itself.
For an alternating series whose terms are positive, decreasing, and tend to zero (which is the case here), the magnitude of the error $|S - S_N|$ is bounded by the absolute value of the first omitted term, i.e., $|a_{N+1}|$. For $N=5$, this is $|a_6| = 24 \cdot 6^2 e^{-6^3} = 864 e^{-216}$. This is the standard and most precise error bound for alternating series, which the gold answer correctly uses.
The model attempts to bound the error by using an integral: $\varepsilon \leq \sum_{n=6}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3} \leq \int_5^\infty 24x^2 e^{-x^3} dx$. While $\int_5^\infty f(x) dx$ is an upper bound for $\sum_{n=6}^\infty f(n)$ (for decreasing $f$), and $\sum_{n=6}^\infty |a_n|$ is an upper bound for $|\sum_{n=6}^\infty (-1)^{n-1} a_n|$, this method provides a much looser bound than the direct alternating series error bound.
More critically, the model's calculation of the integral is incorrect:
$\int_5^\infty 24x^2 e^{-x^3} dx = [-8e^{-x^3}]_5^\infty = 0 - (-8e^{-5^3}) = 8e^{-125}$.
The model's result $1/3 e^{-25}$ is numerically incorrect and does not match the actual integral value.
Due to the incorrect method of bounding (missing the most appropriate bound) and the incorrect calculation, the final upper bound provided by the model is incorrect.

The surface $S$ is given by the equation $z = xy$. We can parametrize this surface using the parameters $u$ and $v$ as

$$\vec{r}(u, v) = (u, v, u v)$$

where $0 \leq u \leq \sqrt{3}$ and $0 \leq v \leq 2\pi$.

The surface area element for this parametrization is given by

$$\vec{n}(u, v) \times \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v} = \sqrt{1 + u^2 + v^2} \hat{n}$$

where $\hat{n}$ is the unit normal vector to the surface.

The moment of inertia of $S$ about the $z$-axis is given by

$$I = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\sqrt{3}} \int_0^{uv} (x^2 + y^2) \sqrt{1 + u^2 + v^2} \ du \ dv \ du$$

Numerically, $\frac{116}{15} \approx 7.733$ and $\frac{1}{2}(9 - \sqrt{3}) \approx \frac{1}{2}(9 - 1.732) = \frac{1}{2}(7.268) \approx 3.634$.

**Solution:**

The centroid of a spherical shell is given by the formula

$$\vec{r}_C = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^a \int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi \frac{\vec{r}}{r} dr d\theta d\phi$$

where

$$\vec{r} = a\sin\theta\cos\phi \mathbf{i} + a\sin\theta\sin\phi \mathbf{j} + a\cos\theta \mathbf{k}$$

is the position vector of a point on the surface of the sphere, $M$ is the total mass of the shell, and $M$ is the mass of the part of the shell that lies in the first octant.

The mass of a spherical shell is given by the formula

$$M = \rho V = \rho\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the shell and $V$ is its volume.

In the first octant, the volume of the shell is given by

$$V = \frac{1}{8}\pi a^3$$

Therefore, the total mass of the part of the shell that lies in the first octant is

$$M = \rho\frac{1}{8}\pi a^3$$

Substituting this into the formula for the centroid, we get

$$\vec{r}_C = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^a \int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi \frac{\vec{r}}{r} dr d\theta d\phi = \frac{a}{2}\mathbf{i} + \frac{a}{2}\mathbf{j}$$

Final Answer:

$$\vec{r}_C = \frac{a}{2}\mathbf{i} + \frac{a}{2}\mathbf{j}$$"," The model fundamentally misunderstands the question. The question asks for the centroid of a ""spherical shell"", which implies a surface, not a solid volume.

1.  **Incorrect Centroid Formula:** The model starts with a formula for the centroid that appears to be for a solid volume, $\vec{r}_C = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^a \int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi \frac{\vec{r}}{r} dr d\theta d\phi$. This is incorrect for a surface integral and also contains incorrect integration limits for $\theta$ and $\phi$ for even a volume in spherical coordinates. The $dr$ component is inappropriate for a shell.
2.  **Incorrect Mass/Volume:** The model calculates the mass using the volume of a solid sphere ($M = \rho V = \rho\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3$) and then incorrectly states the volume of the first octant shell as $V = \frac{1}{8}\pi a^3$ (it should be $\frac{1}{6}\pi a^3$ for a solid octant, or $\frac{\pi a^2}{2}$ for the surface area of the shell in the first octant). For a shell, mass is typically defined by surface density times surface area.
3.  **Missing $z$-component and Incorrect Result:** The final answer given by the model is $\vec{r}_C = \frac{a}{2}\mathbf{i} + \frac{a}{2}\mathbf{j}$. By symmetry, the $z$-component must be equal to the $x$ and $y$ components, and it should be non-zero for a shell in the first octant. The gold answer correctly finds all three components as $a/2$. The model's answer is incomplete and therefore incorrect.

**Solution:**

The equation of the tangent line to a surface given by the function $z=f(x,y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is given by

$$z-z_0 = f_x(x_0,y_0) (x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0) (y-y_0)  $$

where $z_0=f(x_0,y_0)$ is the value of the function at the point $(x_0, y_0)$ and $f_x(x_0,y_0)$ and $f_y(x_0,y_0)$ are the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, respectively, at the point $(x_0, y_0)$.

In this problem, the function $f(x,y)=g(x,y)$ defines the surface of intersection of the two surfaces $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)$. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the curve of intersection of the surfaces at the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0=f(x_0,y_0))$ is given by

**Final Answer:**

The equation of the tangent line to the curve of intersection of the surfaces $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)$ at $(x_0, y_0, z_0=f(x_0,y_0))$ is

$$z-z_0 = f_x(x_0,y_0) (x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0) (y-y_0)  $$"," The model's final answer provides the equation for the tangent *plane* to a surface $z=f(x,y)$ at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, not the equation of the tangent *line* to the curve of intersection of two surfaces.

Furthermore, the model incorrectly states that ""$f(x,y)=g(x,y)$ defines the surface of intersection"", which is a conceptual error; the intersection of two surfaces $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)$ is generally a curve, not another surface of the form $z=h(x,y)$.

prob_s3.2.tex,"\begin{question}[M200 2008D] %1
A surface is given by
\begin{equation*}
z = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 .
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at $x = a$, $y = 2a$.

\item 
For what value of $a$ is the tangent plane parallel to the plane 
$x - y + z = 1$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
(a)
The surface is $G(x,y,z)=z-x^2+2xy-y^2=0$. When $x=a$ and $y=2a$
 and $(x,y,z)$ is on the surface, we have $z= a^2-2(a)(2a) +(2a)^2=a^2$.
So, by part (c) of Theorem \eref{CLP317}{thm:normalVectors} 
in the CLP-4 text, 
a normal vector to this surface at $(a,2a,a^2)$ is
\begin{align*}
\vnabla G(a,2a,a^2) = ( -2x+2y\,,\,2x-2y\,,\,1)\Big|_{(x,y,z)=(a,2a,a^2)}
                    = ( 2a\,,\,-2a\,,\,1)

\begin{align*}
( 2a\,,\,-2a\,,\,1)\cdot( x-a\,,\,y-2a\,,\,z-a^2) =0

2ax -2ay +z = -a^2

(b) The two planes are parallel when their two normal vectors,
namely $( 2a\,,\,-2a\,,\,1)$ and $( 1\,,\,-1\,,\,1)$,
are parallel. This is the case if and only if $a=\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{solution}",Surface Integrals,CLP4,"

**SOLUTION:**

The partial derivatives of the surface with respect to $x$ and $y$ are

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2x - 2y$$

At the point $x = a$, $y = 2a$, these partial derivatives are

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2a - 2(2a) = -2a$$

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2(2a) - 2a = 2a$$

The equation of the tangent plane to the surface at this point is

$$\begin{equation*}
z - (a^2 - 2(2a) + (2a)^2) = -2a(x - a) + 2a(y - 2a)
\end{equation*}$$

For the tangent plane to be parallel to the plane $x - y + z = 1$, we need the normal vector of the tangent plane to be parallel to the normal vector of the plane $x - y + z = 1$. The normal vector of the plane $x - y + z = 1$ is

$$\vec{n}_1 = \hat{i} - \hat{j} + \hat{k}$$

The normal vector of the tangent plane is

$$\vec{n}_2 = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \hat{i} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \hat{j} - \hat{k}$$

For these two vectors to be parallel, we need

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 1, \quad \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -1$$

Substituting these values into the equation of the tangent plane, we get

$$\begin{equation*}
z - (a^2 - 2(2a) + (2a)^2) = a(x - a) - (2a) (y - 2a)
\end{equation*}$$

Final Answer: The tangent plane to the surface is parallel to the plane $x - y + z = 1$ when $a = 1$.","
The model's solution for part (a) is correct. Although there's a minor initial error in stating that $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2x - 2y$ (the partial derivative with respect to $y$ should be $-2x+2y$), the model proceeds to correctly calculate the values of the partial derivatives at the given point ($x=a, y=2a$) as $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = -2a$ and $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2a$. Using these values, the equation of the tangent plane derived by the model, $z - (a^2 - 2(2a) + (2a)^2) = -2a(x - a) + 2a(y - 2a)$, simplifies to $z = -2ax + 2ay - a^2$, which is equivalent to the gold answer's $2ax - 2ay + z = -a^2$.

However, the model's solution for part (b) is incorrect.
1.  The model correctly identifies the normal vector of the given plane as $\vec{n}_1 = (1, -1, 1)$.
2.  The model correctly identifies the general form of the normal vector of the tangent plane as $\vec{n}_2 = (\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}, -1)$, which when evaluated at $(a,2a)$ becomes $(-2a, 2a, -1)$.
3.  For the planes to be parallel, their normal vectors must be parallel, meaning $\vec{n}_2 = k \vec{n}_1$ for some scalar $k$.
    So, $(-2a, 2a, -1) = k(1, -1, 1)$.
    From the z-component, $-1 = k \cdot 1 \implies k = -1$.
    Substituting $k=-1$ into the x and y components:
    $-2a = -1 \cdot 1 \implies -2a = -1 \implies a = 1/2$.
    $2a = -1 \cdot (-1) \implies 2a = 1 \implies a = 1/2$.
    Thus, the correct value is $a = 1/2$.

4.  The model, however, incorrectly states the condition for parallelism as ""we need $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 1, \quad \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -1$"". This implies setting $\vec{n}_2 = (1, -1, -1)$ and checking if it's parallel to $\vec{n}_1 = (1, -1, 1)$. This condition is only valid if $k=1$, which is not the case here since the third components are $-1$ and $1$. This condition leads to a contradiction ($(-2a, 2a, -1) = (1, -1, -1)$ implies $-1=1$ from the z-component).
5.  Despite this faulty reasoning, the model then states the ""Final Answer: ... $a = 1$"". This value ($a=1$) does not follow from any of the model's derived conditions or calculations (even its incorrect ones). If $a=1$, then the normal vector of the tangent plane would be $(-2, 2, -1)$, which is parallel to $(1, -1, 1)$ with $k=-2$. However, the gold answer is $a=1/2$.

Since the final answer for part (b) is incorrect and the reasoning for it is fundamentally flawed, the overall evaluation is Incorrect.

Friendly (?) bees fly towards your face from all directions. The  speed of each bee is inversely proportional to its distance from your face.  Find a vector field for the velocity of the swarm.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Set your face to be at the origin of our coordinate system, $(0,0,0)$. A bee at position $(x,y,z)$ is a distance of $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ from your face, heading in the direction $(-x,-y,-z)$. So, the unit vector indicating the direction of travel of one bee is $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x,y,z)$. Now all we need to find is the length of the velocity vector, i.e. the speed of the bee.

The speed of the friendly bee is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, its distance from your face. (Bees that are closer to you are buzzing towards you more excitedly.) So, the speed is given by $\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$ for some constant $\alpha$. 

The bee velocity has the direction of the unit vector $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x,y,z)$ with length  $\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$ for some positive constant $\alpha$. That is,
\[\vv(x,y,z)=-\frac{\alpha}{{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x,y,z)\]
\end{solution}",Vector Fields,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

The speed of a bee is inversely proportional to its distance from your face. This means that the closer a bee is to your face, the faster it will fly. Conversely, the farther a bee is from your face, the slower it will fly.

To find a vector field for the velocity of the swarm, we need to first define the vector field for the velocity of a single bee. Let's call this vector field \vec{v}_b. We can write \vec{v}_b as:

$$\vec{v}_b = \frac{1}{r} \hat{r}$$

where \hat{r} is the unit vector pointing towards the bee's position from your face, and $r$ is the distance from your face to the bee.

Now that we have the vector field for a single bee, we can find the vector field for the velocity of the swarm by adding the vector field for each bee in the swarm. Let's call this vector field \vec{v}_s. We can write \vec{v}_s as:

$$\vec{v}_s = \sum_b \frac{1}{r_b} \hat{r}_b$$

where the sum is over all bees in the swarm, $r_b$ is the distance from your face to the $b$-th bee, and \hat{r}_b is the unit vector pointing towards the $b$-th bee's position from your face.

**Final Answer:**

$$\vec{v}_s = \sum_b \frac{1}{r_b} \hat{r}_b$$"," The model's final answer is incorrect for two main reasons:
1.  **Direction of Velocity:** The problem states bees fly ""towards your face"". If $\hat{r}$ is defined as the unit vector pointing *from* your face *to* the bee (which is the standard interpretation of ""unit vector pointing towards the bee's position from your face""), then the velocity must be in the $-\hat{r}$ direction, not $\hat{r}$. The model's $\vec{v}_b = \frac{1}{r} \hat{r}$ implies bees are flying *away* from the face.
2.  **Meaning of a Vector Field:** The question asks for ""a vector field for the velocity of the swarm."" A vector field is a function that assigns a vector to *each point in space* (e.g., $\vec{v}(x,y,z)$), describing the velocity of a particle *at that point*. The model's final answer, $\vec{v}_s = \sum_b \frac{1}{r_b} \hat{r}_b$, is a sum over discrete bees, not a continuous vector field representing the velocity at any given point in space. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of what a vector field represents in this context.
Additionally, the proportionality constant (like $\alpha$ in the gold answer) is missing from the speed calculation. ",False

**Solution:**

The energy of a system is given by the sum of its potential energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy is stored energy due to the position of a particle relative to a reference point, and the kinetic energy is the energy of motion of a particle.

In this problem, the particle is moving in a plane, so its potential energy is given by the height above a reference point. The height is given by the function $y(t)$. The potential energy is therefore $mgy(t)$. The kinetic energy is given by the formula $K=\frac{1}{2}m|\vv|^2$, where $\vv$ is the particle's velocity vector. Since the particle is moving in a plane, its velocity vector is given by $\vv(t)=(\dot{x}(t), \dot{y}(t),0)$.

The curve is $\vr(t) = (t,t,t)$, for $0\le t\le\pi/2$. Thus, $x=t, y=t, z=t$.
The derivative is $\frac{d\vr}{dt} = (1,1,1)$.

The vector field is $\vF = \big(yz\cos x\,,\,z\sin x+2yz\,,\,y\sin x+y^2-\sin z\big)$.
Substituting $x=t, y=t, z=t$ into $\vF$, we get:
$\vF(\vr(t)) = \big(t^2\cos t\,,\,t\sin t+2t^2\,,\,t\sin t+t^2-\sin t\big)$.

The integrand for the line integral is $\vF(\vr(t))\cdot\frac{d\vr}{dt}$:
$(t^2\cos t)(1) + (t\sin t+2t^2)(1) + (t\sin t+t^2-\sin t)(1)$
$= t^2\cos t + 2t\sin t + 3t^2 - \sin t$.

The integral is $\int_0^{\pi/2} (t^2\cos t + 2t\sin t + 3t^2 - \sin t) dt$.
We can observe that $t^2\cos t + 2t\sin t = \frac{d}{dt}(t^2\sin t)$.
So the integral becomes $\int_0^{\pi/2} \left(\frac{d}{dt}(t^2\sin t) + 3t^2 - \sin t\right) dt$.

Evaluating the integral:
$\left[t^2\sin t + t^3 + \cos t\right]_0^{\pi/2}$
At $t=\pi/2$: $(\pi/2)^2\sin(\pi/2) + (\pi/2)^3 + \cos(\pi/2) = \frac{\pi^2}{4}(1) + \frac{\pi^3}{8} + 0 = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^3}{8}$.
At $t=0$: $0^2\sin(0) + 0^3 + \cos(0) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1$.

So the value of the integral is $\left(\frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{\pi^3}{8}\right) - 1$. This matches the gold answer.

The model's derivation is flawed. It incorrectly maintains $y$ and $z$ in its intermediate expressions, even after substituting the curve parametrization. More critically, its calculation of the antiderivative ($yz\sin t+y^2\cos t- \sin t$) and its final evaluation are incorrect, leading to a wrong numerical result. ",False

The potential $f$ must obey
\begin{align*}
\pdiff{f}{x}(x,y,z)

\pdiff{f}{y}(x,y,z) &= \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz} \\
\pdiff{f}{z}(x,y,z) &= y^2 e^{yz}
\end{align*}
Integrating the last of these equations with respect to $z$ gives
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y,z) = ye^{yz} +g(x,y)
\end{equation*}
Substituting this into the second equation gives 
\begin{equation*}
e^{yz} + yze^{yz} +\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(x,y) = \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz}
\qquad\text{or}\qquad
\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(x,y)=\cos^2 x
\end{equation*}
which forces
\begin{equation*}
g(x,y) =  y\cos^2 x + h(x)

Finally, substituting $f(x,y,z) = ye^{yz} + y\cos^2 x + h(x)$

\begin{equation*}
-2y\sin x\cos x + h'(x)

So $h(x) = C$ and hence $f(x,y,z) =  ye^{yz} + y\cos^2 x + C$

**Solution:**

The vector field

$$\vF(x, y, z) = -2y \cos x \sin x\,\hat{i} + (\cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz} )\,\hat{j} + y^2 e^{yz}\,\hat{k}$$

is conservative, therefore there exists a function $f (x, y, z)$ such that

$$\vF = \vnabla f \Rightarrow \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -2y \cos x \sin x, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = y^2 e^{yz}$$

Solving these partial differential equations, we find

$$f (x, y, z) = -2y \cos x \sin x + \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz} + y^2 e^{yz} + C$$

where $C$ is a constant of integration. To find the constant of integration, we use the boundary condition

$$f(0, 1, -\pi^2) = 0$$

Substituting these values into the equation for $f$, we find

$$C = 0$$

Therefore, the function $f (x, y, z)$ is

$$f (x, y, z) = -2y \cos x \sin x + \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz} + y^2 e^{yz}$$

**Final Answer:**

Final Answer: The function $f (x, y, z)$ such that $\vF = \vnabla f$ is

$$f (x, y, z) = -2y \cos x \sin x + \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz} + y^2 e^{yz}$$"," The model's final answer for the function $f(x,y,z)$ in part (a) is incorrect. The method used to derive it is fundamentally flawed. A potential function $f$ must satisfy $\nabla f = \vF$. This means $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = F_x$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = F_y$, and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = F_z$. The model appears to have simply summed the components of $\vF$ to get $f$, which is incorrect. For example, if we take the partial derivative of the model's proposed $f$ with respect to $x$:
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( -2y \cos x \sin x + \cos^2 x + (1 + yz) e^{yz} + y^2 e^{yz} \right)$
$= -2y (\cos^2 x - \sin^2 x) - 2 \cos x \sin x$
$= -2y \cos(2x) - \sin(2x)$
This is not equal to $F_x = -2y \cos x \sin x$.

The gold answer correctly finds $f(x,y,z) = ye^{yz} + y\cos^2 x + C$.

\end{solution}",Vector Fields,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

The distance between two points $P$ and $Q$ on a curve $C$ is given by the formula

$$\text{distance between $P$ and $Q$} = \int_C\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}$$

where $\vF$ is the vector function that describes the curve and $\dee{\vr}$ is the differential of the position vector $\vr$.

In this case, the curve $C$ is the $x$-axis, so the position vector is given by

$$\vr(t) = (t, 0)$$

where $0 \leq t \leq 1$. The differential of the position vector is

$$\dee{\vr}(t) = (1, 0)$$

Substituting these values into the formula for distance, we get

$$\text{distance between $P$ and $Q$} = \int_0^1 \big(1, y g(y)\big)\cdot(1, 0) \dt = \left|\int_0^1 g(y) \ dy\right|$$

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer:** The distance between two points $P$ and $Q$ on a curve $C$ whose endpoints lie on the $x$-axis is given by

$$\text{distance between $P$ and $Q$} = \left|\int_C\vF\cdot\dee{\vr}\right| = \left|\int_0^1 g(y) \ dy\right|$$"," The model's approach is fundamentally flawed.
1.  **Misinterpretation of the curve C:** The problem states ""for any curve C whose endpoints P and Q lie on the x-axis"". The model incorrectly assumes that the curve C *is* the x-axis. This is a critical misunderstanding, as C can be any path (e.g., a path in the upper half-plane) as long as its start and end points are on the x-axis.
2.  **Incorrect Calculation:** Even with its incorrect assumption that $C$ is the $x$-axis parameterized by $\vr(t)=(t,0)$, $y=0$. Then $\vF(t,0) = (1, 0 \cdot g(0)) = (1,0)$. The differential is $\dee{\vr} = (1,0)dt$. So, $\vF \cdot \dee{\vr} = (1,0) \cdot (1,0) dt = 1 dt$. The integral would then be $\int_0^1 1 dt = 1$. The model's stated result of $\left|\int_0^1 g(y) \ dy\right|$ is completely inconsistent with its own setup and calculation, indicating a significant error in applying the dot product or setting up the integral correctly.
3.  **Final Answer Mismatch:** The gold answer correctly shows that the integral evaluates to $x_1-x_0$ (the difference in x-coordinates of the endpoints), so its absolute value is the distance. The model's final expression for the integral, $\left|\int_0^1 g(y) \ dy\right|$, bears no resemblance to the correct answer $|x_1-x_0|$ and is derived from a faulty premise and incorrect calculation.
