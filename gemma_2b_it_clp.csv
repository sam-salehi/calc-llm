A flower pot rolls out of a window 10m above the ground. How fast is it falling just as it smacks into the ground?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
From Example~\ref*{eg:fallingBallB}, we know that an object falling from rest on the Earth
is subject to the acceleration due to gravity, $9.8~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}$. So, if $h(t)$ is the height of the flower pot $t$ seconds after it rolls out the window, then $h''(t)=-9.8$. (We make the acceleration negative, since the measure ``height"" has ``up"" as the positive direction, while gravity pulls the pot in the negative direction, ``down."")

Then $h'(t)$ is a function whose derivative is the constant $-9.8$ and with $h'(0)=0$ (since the object fell, instead of being thrown up or down), so $h'(t)=-9.8t$.

What we want to know is $h'(t)$ at the time $t$ when the pot hits the ground. We don't know yet exactly what time that happens, so we go a little farther and find an expression for $h(t)$. The function $h(t)$ has derivative $-9.8t$ and $h(0)=10$, so (again following the ideas in Example~\ref*{eg:fallingBallB})
\[h(t)=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+10\]
Now, we can find the time when the pot hits the ground: it is the time when $h(t)=0$\\ (and $t>0$).
\begin{align*}
0&=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+10\\
\frac{9.8}{2}t^2&=10\\
t^2&=\frac{20}{9.8}\\
t&=+\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\approx1.4 ~\mathrm{sec}
\intertext{The velocity of the pot at this time is}
h'\left(\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\right)&=-9.8\left(\sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}}\right)=-\sqrt{20\cdot 9.8}
=-14 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}
\end{align*}

So, the pot is falling at 14 metres per second, just as it hits the ground.
\end{solution}",Applications of Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The flower pot will reach its maximum height 10m when it is 10m above the ground. At that instant, its velocity will be zero.

Using the equation of motion, v^2 = v_i^2 + 2as, where v_i is the initial velocity (0m/s), a is the acceleration (-9.8m/s^2), and s is the displacement (10m), we can calculate the final velocity (v) as:

v = sqrt(v_i^2 + 2as) = sqrt(0^2 + 2(-9.8)(10)) = 14.14m/s.

Therefore, the flower pot will be falling at 14.14m/s just as it smacks into the ground."," The gold answer calculates the final speed as 14 m/s using an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s^2. The model states it uses an acceleration of -9.8 m/s^2 (or 9.8 m/s^2 implicitly). However, its calculation `sqrt(0^2 + 2(-9.8)(10))` would result in `sqrt(-196)`, which is an imaginary number, indicating a sign error in its formula application for the given displacement. Despite this, it arrives at a numerical answer of 14.14 m/s. This value (14.14 m/s) corresponds to using an acceleration of approximately 10 m/s^2 (since `sqrt(2 * 10 * 10) = sqrt(200) approx 14.14`), not 9.8 m/s^2, which contradicts its stated value for 'a'. The final numerical answer of 14.14 m/s does not match the gold answer of 14 m/s, and the model's steps contain inconsistencies. ",False
prob_s3.1.tex,"\begin{question}
A peregrine falcon can dive at a speed of 325 kph. If you were to drop a stone, how high up would you have to be so that the stone reached the same speed in its fall?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is $9.8$ metres per second squared. So, the object's velocity $t$ seconds after being dropped is
\[v(t)=9.8t~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\]
We want $v(t)$ to be the speed of the peregrine's dive, so we should convert that to metres per second:
\[325~\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{hr}}\cdot
\left(\frac{1000~\mathrm{m}}{1~\mathrm{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1~\mathrm{hr}}{3600~\mathrm{sec}}\right)=\frac{1625}{18}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\]
The stone will reach this velocity when
\[9.8t=\frac{1625}{18}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad t=\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\]

What is left to figure out is how far the stone will fall in this time. The position of the stone $s(t)$ has derivative $9.8t$, so
\[s(t)=4.9t^2\]
if we take $s(0)=0$. So, if the stone falls for $\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}$ seconds, in that time it travels
\[s\left(\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\right)=4.9\left(\frac{1625}{18(9.8)}\right)^2\approx 416 ~\mathrm{m}\]
So, you would have to drop a stone from about 416 metres for it to fall as fast as the falcon.
\end{solution}",Applications of Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The stone would reach the same speed in its fall if it were dropped from a height of 16.25 m. 

To see this, we can use the equation for the velocity of an object in free fall:

$$v^2 = v_i^2 + 2as$$

where:

$$v$$ is the final velocity,
$$v_i$$ is the initial velocity,
$$a$$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and
$$s$$ is the displacement.

In this case, we have:

$$v_i = 0 \text{ m/s}, \space v = 325 \text{ kph} = 8.33 \text{ m/s}, \space a = -9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$$

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

$$(8.33)^2 = 0 + 2(-9.8)s$$

$$s = 16.25 \text{ m}$$"," The model's final answer of 16.25 m is incorrect. The correct answer, as per the gold solution, is approximately 416 m.

The model makes a critical error in converting the initial speed of the peregrine falcon. It incorrectly converts 325 kph to 8.33 m/s.
The correct conversion is:
$325~\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{hr}}\cdot \left(\frac{1000~\mathrm{m}}{1~\mathrm{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1~\mathrm{hr}}{3600~\mathrm{sec}}\right) = \frac{325000}{3600}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}} = \frac{1625}{18}~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}} \approx 90.278~\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}$.

If the correct speed (90.278 m/s) were used in the formula $v^2 = v_i^2 + 2as$ ($v_i=0$, $a=9.8$ m/s$^2$), the calculation would be:
$(90.278)^2 = 2(9.8)s$
$8150.11 = 19.6s$
$s = \frac{8150.11}{19.6} \approx 415.82~\mathrm{m}$.

Furthermore, even if we were to accept the incorrect conversion of 8.33 m/s, the subsequent calculation for $s$ is also wrong.
Using the model's incorrect value $v=8.33$ m/s:
$(8.33)^2 = 2(9.8)s$
$69.3889 = 19.6s$
$s = \frac{69.3889}{19.6} \approx 3.54~\mathrm{m}$.

$$C^2+D^2=-1$$

**Solution:**

$$h(x) = 3 + \dfrac{1}{2}(x-2) + 2(x-2)^3$$

$$h'(x) = \dfrac{1}{2} + 6(x-2)$$

Therefore, $h'(2) = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $h''(2) = 6$."," The model correctly identifies $h'(2) = \dfrac{1}{2}$. However, it incorrectly calculates $h''(2)$.

The given third-order Taylor polynomial is $P_3(x) = 3 + \dfrac{1}{2}(x-2) + 2(x-2)^3$.
The general form of a Taylor polynomial about $x=2$ is $P_3(x) = h(2) + h'(2)(x-2) + \dfrac{h''(2)}{2!}(x-2)^2 + \dfrac{h'''(2)}{3!}(x-2)^3$.

Comparing coefficients:
1. The coefficient of $(x-2)$ is $h'(2)$. From the given polynomial, this is $\dfrac{1}{2}$. So, $h'(2) = \dfrac{1}{2}$.
2. The coefficient of $(x-2)^2$ is $\dfrac{h''(2)}{2!}$. In the given polynomial, there is no $(x-2)^2$ term, which means its coefficient is $0$. Therefore, $\dfrac{h''(2)}{2} = 0$, which implies $h''(2) = 0$.

Alternatively, by direct differentiation of the polynomial (which represents $h(x)$ at $x=2$ and its derivatives):
$h(x) = 3 + \dfrac{1}{2}(x-2) + 2(x-2)^3$
$h'(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx} [3 + \dfrac{1}{2}(x-2) + 2(x-2)^3] = 0 + \dfrac{1}{2}(1) + 2 \cdot 3(x-2)^2 \cdot 1 = \dfrac{1}{2} + 6(x-2)^2$.
Then, $h'(2) = \dfrac{1}{2} + 6(2-2)^2 = \dfrac{1}{2} + 0 = \dfrac{1}{2}$.

Now, for the second derivative:
$h''(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx} [\dfrac{1}{2} + 6(x-2)^2] = 0 + 6 \cdot 2(x-2)^1 \cdot 1 = 12(x-2)$.

A sample begins with precisely 1 $\mu$g of a radioactive isotope, and after 3 years is measured to have 0.9 $\mu$g remaining. If this measurement is correct to within 0.05 $\mu$g, estimate the corresponding accuracy of the half-life calculated using it.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Let $q$ be the measured amount of the isotope remaining after 3 years. Let $h(q)$ be the half-life of the isotope that we calculate using $q$.
We measured $q=0.9$, but we want to know what the change in $h$ is if $q$ moves by 0.05. So, let $\Delta q= \pm 0.05$, and let $\Delta h$ be the corresponding change in $h$.
The linear approximation tells us
\begin{align*}\Delta h& \approx h'(0.9)\Delta q

\left|\Delta h\right|&\approx\left| h'(0.9)\right|\left|\Delta q\right|= h'(0.9)\cdot 0.05

Then, we will find $h'(0.9)$. Finally, the equation $\left|\Delta h\right|=h'(0.9)\cdot0.05$ will tell us the change in $h$ that corresponds with a change of 0.05 in our measurement.}

Let us find the half-life of the isotope, if after three years $q$ $\mu$g is remaining. The amount of the isotope present after $t$ years is given by
\begin{align*}
Q(t)&=Q(0)e^{-kt}
\intertext{for some constant $k$. Let's take $t=0$ to be the time when precisely one $\mu$g was present. Then}
Q(t)&=e^{-kt}
\intertext{After three years, $q$ is the amount of the isotope remaining, so}
q&=e^{-k\cdot 3}\\
q^{\frac{1}{3}}&=e^{-k}\\
Q(t)&=\left(e^{-k}\right)^t=q^{\frac{t}{3}}
\intertext{The half-life is the value of $t$ for which $Q(t)=\frac{1}{2}Q(0)=\frac{1}{2}$.}
\frac{1}{2}&=Q(t)=q^{\frac{t}{3}}\\
\log\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)&=\log\left(q^{\frac{t}{3}}\right)\\
-\log 2 &=\frac{t}{3}\log q\\
t&=\frac{-3\log 2}{\log q}
\end{align*}
So, we calculate the half-life to be $\dfrac{-3\log 2}{\log q}$. This gives us our first goal: a function $h(q)$ that tells us the calculated half-life of the element.
\begin{align*}h(q)&=\dfrac{-3\log2}{\log q}
\intertext{Following our plan, we find $h'(0.9)$.}
h'(q)&=\diff{}{q}\left\{\dfrac{-3\log2}{\log q}\right\}\\
&=-3\log 2\cdot\diff{}{q}\left\{\left(\log q\right)^{-1}\right\}\\
&=-3\log 2\cdot(-1)\left(\log q\right)^{-2}\cdot\frac{1}{q}\\
&=\frac{3\log 2}{q\log^2q}\\
h'(0.9)&=\frac{3\log2}{0.9\log^2(0.9)}\approx 208
\intertext{Finally, as outlined in our plan, }
\left|\Delta h\right|&=h'(0.9)\cdot0.05\\
&=\frac{3\log2}{18\log^2(0.9)}\approx 10.4
\end{align*}
If our measurement changes by $\pm 0.05$ $\mu$g, then we estimate our calculated half-life changes by about $\pm$10.4 years. Since our measurement is accurate to within $0.05$ $\mu$g, that means we estimate
our calculated half-life to be accurate to within about 10.4 years.

Remark: since $h(0.9)=\dfrac{-3\log 2}{\log 0.9} \approx 19.7$, an absolute error of 10.4 years corresponds to a percentage error of $100\dfrac{10.4}{19.7}\approx 53\%$. The question did not specify absolute or percentage error. Since both make sense, you can use either one.
\end{solution}",Applications of Derivatives,CLP1,"

**Solution:**

The half-life of the isotope can be calculated using the formula:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{t}{ln(2)}$$

where:

$$t$$ is the half-life, and
$$t_{1/2}$$ is the half-life in years,
$$t$$ is the measurement time in years.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{3}{ln(2)} = 1.8 \text{ years}.$$

The accuracy of the half-life calculation can be estimated using the uncertainty principle, which states that the minimum uncertainty in a measurement is equal to half the difference between the upper and lower limits of the measurement.

Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in the half-life measurement is:

$$\frac{0.05}{2} \text{ years} = 0.025 \text{ years}.$$

The accuracy of the half-life calculation is better than the minimum uncertainty, since it is less than half the difference between the upper and lower limits of the measurement."," The model's approach is fundamentally incorrect.
1.  **Incorrect Half-Life Formula:** The model states $t_{1/2} = \frac{t}{ln(2)}$. This formula is incorrect in the context of radioactive decay where $t$ is the elapsed time and the amount remaining is known. The half-life is defined by the decay constant $k$, specifically $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k}$. The decay constant $k$ must be derived from the given information (1 $\mu$g initial, 0.9 $\mu$g after 3 years).
2.  **Incorrect Calculation of Half-Life:** Based on its incorrect formula, the model calculates $t_{1/2} = \frac{3}{ln(2)} \approx 1.8$ years. This is not the half-life of the isotope given the information. The half-life should be derived from the fact that $0.9 = 1 \cdot e^{-k \cdot 3}$, leading to $k = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{3}$. Then $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k} = \frac{3\ln(2)}{-\ln(0.9)} \approx 19.7$ years (as shown in the gold solution).
3.  **Misunderstanding of Accuracy/Uncertainty:** The model's application of an ""uncertainty principle"" and dividing the measurement accuracy ($0.05 \mu g$) by 2 to get ""0.025 years"" is entirely irrelevant and shows a complete misunderstanding of how to propagate error in a calculated value. The problem requires using differential approximation (calculating the derivative of the half-life function with respect to the measured amount and multiplying by the error in the measurement).
The gold solution correctly identifies this as a problem requiring differential approximation to estimate the propagation of error from the measured quantity to the calculated half-life. The model fails to set up the problem correctly, uses incorrect formulas, and provides an irrelevant calculation. ",False

**Solution:**

Using Taylor's theorem, we have:

$$T_2(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2.$$

Therefore,

$$T_2(0.1) = \tan 0 + 0 + \frac{0}{2!} (0.1)^2 = 0.1.$$

Using Equation~\ref*{eq:taylorErrorN}, we have:

$$|f(0.1)-T_2(0.1)| \le \frac{1}{2!} (0.1)^2 = 0.025.$$

Therefore, a reasonable bound on the error is $|f(0.1)-T(0.1)| \le 0.025$."," The model incorrectly applies the Taylor error bound formula. The formula for the remainder $R_n(x)$ (which represents the error) for a Taylor polynomial of order $n$ is $R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$ for some $c$ between $a$ and $x$.

In this problem, $n=2$, $a=0$, and $x=0.1$. Thus, the error bound should be of the form $\left|\frac{f^{(3)}(c)}{3!}(0.1)^3\right|$.
The gold answer correctly identifies this as $\frac{\left|f'''(c)\right|}{6000}$.

The model's calculation for the bound is $|f(0.1)-T_2(0.1)| \le \frac{1}{2!} (0.1)^2 = 0.025$. This shows a misunderstanding of the formula:
1. It uses $n!$ instead of $(n+1)!$ in the denominator.
2. It uses $(x-a)^n$ instead of $(x-a)^{n+1}$.
3. It completely ignores the $f^{(n+1)}(c)$ term, effectively assuming $|f'''(c)|=1$, which is not justified and incorrect.

The correct process involves calculating $f'''(x)$, finding a maximum bound for $|f'''(c)|$ over the interval $(0, 0.1)$, and then substituting this into the correct error formula.

Since we can't take the square root of a negative number,  $f(x)$ is only defined
when $x \ge 1$. Furthermore, since we can't have zero as a denominator, $x=-2$ is  not in the domain --- but as long as $x \ge 1$, we also have $x \ne -2$. So, the domain of the function is $[1,\infty)$.

2.  The subsequent line ""$a+\frac{b}{2}+\frac{c}{1}=a+\frac{b}{2}+c.$"" is a tautology (it simplifies to $X=X$). An equation that is always true cannot be used to solve for a specific value of $a$. This implies the steps leading to this tautology were also incorrect in their representation of the problem's conditions. For example, the average value of $ax^2+bx+c$ on $[0,1]$ is $\frac{a}{3}+\frac{b}{2}+c$, not $a+\frac{b}{2}+c$. Similarly, the average of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ is $\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}+c$, not $a+\frac{b}{2}+c$.

Find the work (in joules) required to lift a 3-gram block of matter a height of 10 centimetres against the force of gravity (with $g=9.8$ m/sec$^2$).
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Force is mass $\times$ acceleration (with acceleration equal to $g$ in this problem), and both in this scenario are constant, so we don't need an integral--only a product--to calculate the force acting on the block.

To find the force in newtons, recall one newton is one $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}$, so we need the mass of our block in kg. Specifically, our block has mass $\frac{3}{1000}$ kg. So, the force involved is
\[F=\left(\frac{3}{1000}\text{ kg}\right)\times\left(9.8~\frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}\right) = 0.0294~\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} = 0.0294~\text{N}\]

To find the work in joules, recall one joule is one newton-metre: that is, one newton of force acting over one metre. So, we need our distance in metres.
\[W = \big( 0.0294~\text{N}\big)\times\left(\frac{1}{10}~\text{m}\right) = 0.00294~\text{N}\cdot\text{m} = 0.00294~\text{J}\]
\end{solution}",Applications of Integration,CLP2,"

**Solution:**

The work required to lift a block of mass $m$ a height $h$ against the force of gravity is given by the formula:

$$W = mgh$$

In this case, $m = 3 \mathrm{ g} = 0.003 \mathrm{ kg}$, $h = 10 \mathrm{ cm} = 0.1 \mathrm{ m}$, and $g = 9.8 \mathrm{ m/s}^2$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$$W = (0.003 \mathrm{ kg})(9.8 \mathrm{ m/s}^2)(0.1 \mathrm{ m}) = 0.0294 \mathrm{ J}$$

Therefore, the work required to lift the block of matter a height of 10 centimetres against the force of gravity is 0.0294 joules."," The model's final numerical answer is incorrect.

Put another way, since $a$ and $b$ both describe a quantity in metres, $b-a$ describes a quantity in metres as well. (When we add or subtract quantities of the same units, their sum or difference is given in the same units.) Since $n$ is a unitless quantity (simply a number: not ``$n$ kg"" or ``$n$ m""), $\frac{b-a}{n}$ still describes a quantity in metres.

By Definition \eref{CLP101}{def:WKwork} in the CLP-2 text, the work done in moving the object from $x = 1$ meters

\begin{align*}

units newton-$\sqrt{\text{meter}}\text{s}$.
\end{solution}",Applications of Integration,CLP2,"

**Solution:**

Let the work done in moving the object from $x = 1$ to $x = 16$ meters be equal to $W$. Then, by the work-energy theorem, we have:

$$W = \frac{1}{2} ma^2$$

Substituting the values of $W = 18$ joules and $x = 16$ meters into the equation above, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} a(16)^2 = 18$$

$$a = 18 \cdot \frac{1}{2(16)} = 3$$

**Final Answer: 3 N**"," The model's approach is entirely incorrect.
1.  It incorrectly states the work-energy theorem as $W = \frac{1}{2}ma^2$. The work-energy theorem relates work done to the change in kinetic energy, typically $\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$. The formula used by the model is not the work-energy theorem, nor is it the correct formula for work done by a variable force.
2.  The problem involves calculating work done by integrating the variable force $F(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{x}}$, not using an acceleration 'a' or mass 'm' in a kinetic energy formula.
3.  Even with its incorrect formula $\frac{1}{2}a(16)^2 = 18$, the arithmetic calculation to arrive at $a=3$ is incorrect. $\frac{1}{2}a(256) = 18 \implies 128a = 18 \implies a = \frac{18}{128} = \frac{9}{64}$, not $3$. The model seems to have forced the correct final numerical answer despite completely incorrect reasoning and calculations.
4.  The question explicitly states ""Don't worry about the units of a"" and the gold solution notes the units are ""newton-$\sqrt{\text{meter}}\text{s}$"". The model's final answer includes ""N"" (Newtons), which is also incorrect for the units of 'a'.

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Using Equation~\eref{CLP101}{eq:TRQcentroid} in the CLP-2 text with $T(x) = 2x\sin (x^2)$ and $B(x)=0$,

\[\bar x = \frac{\displaystyle\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} 2x^2\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}}{\displaystyle\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} 2x\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}}\]

We can evaluate the bottom integral exactly with the substitution $u=x^2$, $\dee{u}=2x\dee{x}$. When $x=0$, $u=0$, and when $x=\sqrt{\pi/2}$, $u=\pi/2$.

\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}}2x\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}&=\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin u\,\dee{u}
=\Big[-\cos u\Big]_0^{\pi/2}=1\\
\end{align*}

So, \[\bar x = \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} 2x^2\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x} \]

Evaluating the integral $\int x^2\sin(x^2)\,\dee{x}$ is not so simple\footnote{Indeed, the antiderivative of $2x^2\sin(x^2)$ is not expressible as an elementary function.}, so we use a numerical approximation. Since we're given an upper bound on the fourth derivative, we decide to use Simpson's rule. The error involved using Simpson's rule with $n$ intervals is at most $\frac{L(b-a)^5}{180n^4}$. For our approximation,  $a=0$ and $b=\sqrt{\pi/2}$. According to the information given in the problem statement,
$\left|\ddiff{4}{}{x}\left\{2x^2\sin(x^2)\right\} \right| \leq 415$ over the interval $\left[0,\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right]$, so  we set $L=415$.

We want our final error to be no more than $\frac{1}{100}$, so we want to find an even $n$ such that:
\begin{align*}
\frac{415\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}-0\right)^5}{180n^4} &\leq \frac{1}{100}\\
n^4 &\geq \frac{415\cdot 100\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{5/2}}{180} = \frac{2075\pi^{5/2}}{36\sqrt{2}}\\
n&\geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{2075\pi^{5/2}}{36\sqrt{2}}}\approx 5.17
\end{align*}
So, $n=6$ intervals suffices. Then $\De x = \frac{b-a}{6} = \frac{1}{6}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ and our grid points are $x_0=0$, $x_1=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$, $x_2=\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$, $x_3=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$, $x_4=\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$, $x_5=\frac{5}{6}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$, and , $x_6=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$.

At what points in the $xy$-plane does the curve $(\sin t, t^2)$ cross itself? What is the difference in $t$ between the first time the curve crosses through a point, and the last?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The curve ``crosses itself"" when the same coordinates occur for different values of $t$, say $t_1$ and $t_2$. So, we want to know when $\sin t_1=\sin t_2$ and also $t_1^2=t_2^2$. Since $t_1$ and $t_2$ should be different, the second equation tells us $t_2=-t_1$. Then the first equation tells us $\sin t_1=\sin t_2=\sin(-t_1)=-\sin t_1$. That is, $\sin t_1 = -\sin t_1$, so $\sin t_1=0$. That happens whenever $t_1=\pi n$ for an integer $n$.

So, the points at which the curve crosses itself are those points $(0,(\pi n)^2)$ where $n$ is an integer. It passes such a point at times $t=\pi n $ and $t=-\pi n$. So, the curve hits this point $2\pi n$ time units apart.
\end{solution}",Curves,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the equation:

$$\sin t = t^2$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t^2 = \sin t$$

Setting the two sides equal, we get:

$$0 = \sin t - t^2$$

$$\sin t = t^2$$

The only solution to this equation is $t = 0$.

Therefore, the curve $(\sin t, t^2)$ crosses itself at the point $(0, 0)$.

The difference in $t$ between the first time the curve crosses through a point, and the last, is 0. This is because the curve crosses through the point $(0, 0)$ at the origin, and the curve is symmetric about the origin."," The model fundamentally misunderstands the condition for a curve to cross itself. It attempts to solve for $\sin t = t^2$, which means finding points where the $x$-coordinate equals the $y$-coordinate on the curve. This is incorrect. A curve crosses itself when $(x(t_1), y(t_1)) = (x(t_2), y(t_2))$ for distinct values $t_1 \ne t_2$.

Due to this initial error, the points of crossing identified by the model are incomplete (only $(0,0)$ instead of $(0, (\pi n)^2)$ for all integers $n$), and the calculation for the difference in $t$ is also incorrect, as it only considers the trivial case $t=0$ where the difference is indeed 0, but misses all other crossing points where the difference is $2\pi n$.

A particle traces out a curve in space, so that its position at time $t$ is \[\vr(t)=e^{-t}\,\hi+\frac{1}{t}\,\hj+(t-1)^2(t-3)^2\,\hk\] for $t > 0$. 

Let the positive $z$ axis point vertically upwards, as usual. When is the particle moving upwards, and when is it moving downwards? Is it moving faster at time $t=1$ or at time $t=3$?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
To determine whether the particle is rising or falling, we only need to consider its $z$-coordinate: $z(t)=(t-1)^2(t-3)^2$. Its derivative with respect to time is $z'(t)=4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)$. This is positive when $1<t<2$ and when $3<t$, so the particle is increasing on $(1,2) \cup (3,\infty)$ and decreasing on $(0,1) \cup (2,3)$.

If $\vr(t)$ is the position of the particle at time $t$, then its speed is $|\vr'(t)|$. We differentiate:
\[\vr'(t)=-e^{-t}\,\hi-\frac{1}{t^2}\,\hj+4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)\hk\]
So, $\vr(1)=-\frac{1}{e}\,\hi-1\,\hj$ and $\vr(3)=-\frac{1}{e^3}\,\hi-\frac{1}{9}\,\hj$. The absolute value of every component of $\vr(1)$ is greater than or equal to that of the corresponding component of $\vr(3)$, so $|\vr(1)|>|\vr(3)|$. That is, the particle is moving more swiftly at $t=1$ than at $t=3$.

Note: We could also compute the sizes of both vectors directly: $|\vr'(1)|=\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{e}\right)^2+(-1)^2}$, and $|\vr'(3)|=\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{e^3}\right)^2+\left(-\frac{1}{9}\right)^2}$.
\end{solution}",Curves,CLP4,"

**Final Answer: The particle is moving upwards when $0<t<1$ and moving downwards when $1<t<3$. At time $t=1$, the particle is moving at a greater speed than at time $t=3$."," The model's answer for when the particle is moving upwards and downwards is incorrect.
According to the gold answer and calculation of $z'(t) = 4(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)$:
- The particle is moving upwards when $1<t<2$ and $t>3$.
- The particle is moving downwards when $0<t<1$ and $2<t<3$.

The model states it's moving upwards when $0<t<1$ (which is incorrect, it's downwards) and downwards when $1<t<3$ (which is partially incorrect as it includes an upward interval $1<t<2$).

The second part of the model's answer, comparing the speeds at $t=1$ and $t=3$, is correct. However, due to the significant errors in the first part, the overall answer is deemed incorrect. ",False

**Solution:**

Let $C(t) = \left(t,\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^2,t^3\right)$. Then, by the Chain Rule,

If a particle has constant mass $m$, position $\vr$, and is moving with velocity $\vv$, then its angular momentum is $\vL=m(\vr\times\vv)$. 

For a particle with mass $m=1$ and position function $\vr=(\sin t, \cos t, t)$, find $\left|\diff{\vL}{t} \right|$.

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Given the position of the particle, we can find its velocity:
\[\vv(t)=\vr'(t)=(\cos t, -\sin t , 1)\]
Applying the given formula,
\[\vL(t)=\vr \times \vv=(\sin t , \cos t , t) \times (\cos t, -\sin t , 1).\]
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Solution 1:}]
We can first compute the cross product, then differentiate:
\begin{align*}
\vL(t)& = (\cos t + t\sin t)\hi + (t\cos t - \sin t)\hj-\hk\\
\vL'(t)&=t\cos t\,\hi -t\sin t\, \hj\\
|\vL'(t)|&=\sqrt{t^2(\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t)}=\sqrt{t^2}=|t|
\end{align*}
\item[\textbf{Solution 2:}]
Using the product rule:
\begin{align*}
\vL'(t)&=\vr'(t)\times \vv(t) + \vr(t) \times \vv'(t)\\
&=\underbrace{\vr'(t)\times \vr'(t)}_{0} + \vr(t) \times \vv'(t)\\
&= (\sin t ,\cos t,t)\times(-\sin t , -\cos t, 0)\\
&=t\cos t\,\hi-t\sin t\,\hj\\
|\vL'(t)|&=\sqrt{t^2\cos^2 t + t^2\sin t^2  }=|t|
\end{align*}
\end{description}
\end{solution}",Curves,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

$$\begin{split} \frac{d\vL}{dt} &= \frac{d}{dt}[m(\vr\times\vv)] \\\ &=m\left(\frac{d}{dt}[\vr]\times\vv + \vr\times\frac{d}{dt}[\vv]\right) \\\ &=m(\cos t, -\sin t, 1)\cdot(\cos t, -\sin t, 1) \\\ & = -m\sin t \\\ \left|\frac{d\vL}{dt} \right| &= m \end{split}$$

Therefore, $\left|\frac{d\vL}{dt} \right| = m$ for all $t$."," The model correctly identifies the use of the product rule for angular momentum: $\frac{d\vL}{dt} = m(\vr' \times \vv + \vr \times \vv')$. It also correctly identifies that $\vr' = \vv$, leading to the simplification $\vr' \times \vv = \vv \times \vv = 0$. So, $\frac{d\vL}{dt} = m(\vr \times \vv')$.

However, the model then makes a significant error in the calculation. It incorrectly writes:
`$=m(\cos t, -\sin t, 1)\cdot(\cos t, -\sin t, 1)$`
This is a dot product of $\vv$ with itself, not the required cross product $\vr \times \vv'$.

The correct calculation for $\vr \times \vv'$ (with $\vr = (\sin t, \cos t, t)$ and $\vv' = (-\sin t, -\cos t, 0)$) is:
$\vr \times \vv' = (\cos t \cdot 0 - t \cdot (-\cos t))\mathbf{i} - (\sin t \cdot 0 - t \cdot (-\sin t))\mathbf{j} + (\sin t \cdot (-\cos t) - \cos t \cdot (-\sin t))\mathbf{k}$
$= (t\cos t)\mathbf{i} - (t\sin t)\mathbf{j} + (-\sin t \cos t + \sin t \cos t)\mathbf{k}$
$= (t\cos t, -t\sin t, 0)$

So, $\frac{d\vL}{dt} = m(t\cos t, -t\sin t, 0)$.

Given $m=1$, $\frac{d\vL}{dt} = (t\cos t, -t\sin t, 0)$.
The magnitude is $\left|\frac{d\vL}{dt}\right| = \sqrt{(t\cos t)^2 + (-t\sin t)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{t^2\cos^2 t + t^2\sin^2 t} = \sqrt{t^2(\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t)} = \sqrt{t^2} = |t|$.

The model's subsequent steps of calculating `-m sin t` and then a final magnitude of `m` (which is 1) are incorrect. The final answer should be $|t|$, not $m$. ",False

Let $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $h(a) = f(a) - g(a) > 0$ and $h(b) = f(b) - g(b) > 0$.

Since $h(a)$ and $h(b)$ are positive, it follows that $h(c) > 0$ for some $c \in (a,b)$.

Furthermore, since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable, it follows that $h'(c) \neq 0$ for some $c \in (a,b)$.

Therefore, there exists some $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c)>g'(c)$."," The model's reasoning is fundamentally flawed.
1.  **Incorrect initial condition:** The model states $h(a) = f(a) - g(a) > 0$. However, the problem statement says $f(a) < g(a)$, which implies $h(a) = f(a) - g(a) < 0$. This is a critical error.
2.  **Incorrect inference:** Based on the incorrect premise that $h(a)>0$ and the correct $h(b)>0$, the model states ""it follows that $h(c) > 0$ for some $c \in (a,b)$"". This is true but trivial and does not help in proving the existence of $c$ where $f'(c) > g'(c)$.
3.  **Incorrect application/statement of theorem:** The model states, ""Furthermore, since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable, it follows that $h'(c) \neq 0$ for some $c \in (a,b)$."" This statement is generally false and does not follow from differentiability. There is no theorem that guarantees $h'(c) \neq 0$ under these conditions. The Mean Value Theorem, which is key to solving this problem, requires considering the *slope* of the secant line, not just non-zero derivative.
4.  **Lack of justification for the conclusion:** The final conclusion, ""Therefore, there exists some $c \in (a,b)$ with $f'(c)>g'(c)$,"" is stated without proper justification or a logical connection to the preceding incorrect statements. The problem requires a proof that *derives* this conclusion, not just states it.

1.  The model's algebraic manipulation $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \cdot \frac{g(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)^2}$ is incorrect. It should be $\frac{f(x)g(x)}{g(x)^2}$.
2.  More importantly, this manipulation does not involve differentiation at all, which is the core operation in the question ($\diff{}{x}\left\{\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right\}$). The model completely fails to apply any differentiation rule (like the quotient rule).

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Recall that $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{\sin x}{x} =1$. In order to take advantage of this knowledge, we divide the numerator and denominator by $x^5$ (because $5$ is the power of sine in the denominator, and a denominator that goes to zero generally makes a limit harder).

Now the denominator goes to 1, which is nice, but we need to take care of the fraction $\dfrac{\sin x^{27}}{x^5}$ in the numerator. This fraction isn't very familiar, but we know that, as $x$ goes to zero, $x^{27}$ also goes to zero,

\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}  \dfrac{\sin x^{27}+2x^5 e^{x^{99}}}{\sin^5 x}

**Solution:**

Since the sine function is continuous at \(u = 0\), we have

$$\lim\limits_{u\rightarrow 0} \dfrac{\sin u+2u^5 e^{u^{99}}}{\sin^5 u} = \dfrac{1}{1} = 1.$$"," The model's final answer is 1, whereas the correct answer is 2.

The model makes an incorrect substitution: it sets $u = x^{27}$ but then incorrectly replaces $x^5$ with $u^5$ and $x^{99}$ with $u^{99}$ in the second term of the numerator. If $u = x^{27}$, then $x = u^{1/27}$, so $x^5 = u^{5/27}$ and $x^{99} = u^{99/27} = u^{11/3}$. The resulting expression would be $\lim\limits_{u\rightarrow 0} \dfrac{\sin u+2u^{5/27} e^{u^{11/3}}}{\left(\sin u^{1/27}\right)^5}$, which is not what the model wrote.

Furthermore, even if the substituted expression $\lim\limits_{u\rightarrow 0} \dfrac{\sin u+2u^5 e^{u^{99}}}{\sin^5 u}$ was correct, its evaluation to $\dfrac{1}{1}=1$ is incorrect. For this expression, as $u \to 0$:
The numerator behaves as $\sin u + 2u^5 e^{u^{99}} \approx u + 2u^5 \approx u$ (since $u$ is the dominant term).
The denominator behaves as $\sin^5 u \approx u^5$.
Thus, the limit would behave as $\lim_{u\rightarrow 0} \dfrac{u}{u^5} = \lim_{u\rightarrow 0} \dfrac{1}{u^4}$, which tends to infinity, not 1. ",False

**Solution:**

Let's consider the energy as a function of time, given by the expression:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\right\|^2$$

where \(\vec{r}(t)\) and \(\vec{v}(t)\) are the position and velocity vectors, respectively.

Then, using the given equation for the acceleration, we have:

$$\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$$

Substituting this into the expression for the energy, we get:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 - \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 = \text{constant}$$

Therefore, the energy is constant, as claimed."," The model's approach is fundamentally flawed.
1.  **Incorrect Quantity:** The question asks to show that $|\vr(t)|^2+|\vr'(t)|^2$ is constant. The model introduces a different ""energy"" quantity: $E = \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\right\|^2$, which translates to $E = \frac{1}{2}|\vr'|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|\vr''|^2$. This is not the quantity specified in the question.
2.  **Misinterpretation of Condition:** The given condition is $\vr''(t)=-\vr(t)$. The model incorrectly interprets this as $\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$, which means $\vr''(t) = -\vr'(t)$. This is a crucial error.
3.  **Algebraic Error:** Even with its incorrect setup, the substitution step is flawed. If $\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$, then $\left\|\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\right\|^2 = \left\|-\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 = \left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2$. Substituting this into its energy expression $E = \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\right\|^2$ should yield $E = \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 = \left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2$, not $E = \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 - \frac{1}{2}\left\|\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right\|^2 = \text{constant}$.

**Solution:**

Let the coordinates of the vertices be:

$$P(0, 0, 0), \quad Q(1, 0, 0), \quad R(1, 1, 0), \quad S(0, 1, 0)$$

Then, the vectors are:

$$\overrightarrow{PQ} = \langle 1 - 0, 0 - 0, 0 - 0 \rangle = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle$$

$$\overrightarrow{PR} = \langle 1 - 1, 1 - 0, 1 - 0 \rangle = \langle 0, 1, 1 \rangle$$

$$\overrightarrow{PS} = \langle 0 - 0, 1 - 0, 0 - 0 \rangle = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle$$

The centroid of the face opposite to $P$ is $\left(\frac{1}{3}, 0, 0\right)$. The vector from the origin to this point is:

$$\overrightarrow{PC} = \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{PQ} = \frac{1}{3} \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle = \langle \frac{1}{3}, 0, 0 \rangle$$

The vector from the origin to the centroid of the face opposite to $Q$ is:

$$\overrightarrow{QC} = \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{PR} = \frac{1}{3} \langle 0, 1, 1 \rangle = \langle 0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3} \rangle$$

The vector from the origin to the centroid of the face opposite to $R$ is:

$$\overrightarrow{CR} = \frac{1}{3} \overrightarrow{PS} = \frac{1}{3} \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle = \langle 0, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \rangle$$

1.  **Incorrect Setup/Approach:** The model attempts to solve the problem by assigning specific coordinates to the vertices. While a coordinate-based solution is possible, it is much more complex than the general vector approach and is not typically the expected method for this type of problem, especially when the question uses general vector notation ($\vp, \vq, \vr, \vs$). The gold solution provides a concise general vector proof.
2.  **Incorrect Centroid Calculations:** The model makes significant errors in calculating the centroids of the faces. For example, with $P(0,0,0), Q(1,0,0), R(1,1,0), S(0,1,0)$, the face opposite to $P$ is the triangle $QRS$. Its centroid should be $\frac{1}{3}(\vq+\vr+\vs) = \frac{1}{3}((1,0,0) + (1,1,0) + (0,1,0)) = \frac{1}{3}(2,2,0) = (\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 0)$. The model states ""The centroid of the face opposite to P is (1/3, 0, 0)"", which is incorrect. The subsequent vector calculation $\overrightarrow{PC} = \frac{1}{3}\overrightarrow{PQ}$ is also incorrect and nonsensical in this context.

A marble is placed on the plane $ax+by+cz=d$. The coordinate
system has been chosen so that the positive $z$--axis points straight up.
The coefficient $c$ is nonzero and the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are not
both zero.
In which direction does the marble roll? 
Why were the conditions ``$c\ne 0$'' and ``$a,b$ not both zero'' imposed?
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The marble is subject to two forces. The first, gravity, is
$-mg\,\hk$ with $m$ being the mass of the marble. The second is the normal
force imposed by the plane. This forces acts in a direction perpendicular
to the plane. One vector normal to the plane is $a\,\hi+b\,\hj+c\,\hk$. 
So the force due to the plane is $T\llt a,b,c\rgt$ with $T$ determined  by the
property that the net force perpendicular to the plane must be exactly
zero, so that the marble remains on the plane, neither digging into nor
flying off of it. The projection of the gravitational force onto the normal
vector $\llt a,b,c\rgt$ is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt\cdot\llt a,b,c\rgt}{|\llt a,b,c\rgt|^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt
=\frac{-mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt
\end{equation*}
The condition that determines $T$ is thus
\begin{equation*}
T\llt a,b,c\rgt+\frac{-mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt =0
\implies T=\frac{mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}
\end{equation*}
The total force on the marble is then (ignoring friction -- which will
have no effect on the direction of motion)
\begin{align*}
T\llt a,b,c\rgt-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt&=\frac{mgc}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\llt a,b,c\rgt-mg\llt 0,0,1\rgt\cr
&=mg\frac{c\llt a,b,c\rgt-\llt 0,0,a^2+b^2+c^2\rgt}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\cr
&=mg\frac{\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\cr
\end{align*}
The direction of motion $\llt ac,bc,-a^2-b^2\rgt$. If you want to turn
this into a unit vector, just divide by $\sqrt{(a^2+b^2)(a^2+b^2+c^2)}$.
Note that the direction vector in perpendicular $\llt a,b,c\rgt$ and hence is parallel
to the plane. If $c=0$, the plane is vertical. In this case, the marble
doesn't roll -- it falls straight down. If $a=b=0$, the plane is horizontal.
 In this case, the marble doesn't roll --- it remains stationary.
\end{solution}",Geometry in two and three dimensions,CLP3,"

**Solution:** 
The marble will roll down the negative $z$-axis. This is because the negative $z$-axis points down, and the positive $z$-axis points straight up. The conditions are imposed to ensure that the marble rolls in the correct direction. 

The negative $z$-axis is chosen because it is perpendicular to the positive $z$-axis, which is the direction of motion of the marble. The conditions ensure that the marble rolls down the negative $z$-axis, rather than up the positive $z$-axis."," The model's answer for the direction of motion is incorrect. The marble does not generally roll down the negative z-axis; its direction of motion is determined by the specific coefficients of the plane, as derived in the gold answer (specifically, $\langle ac, bc, -a^2-b^2 \rangle$). The reasoning provided for the conditions ""$c \ne 0$"" and ""$a,b$ not both zero"" is also incorrect and nonsensical.

(a) $AA'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and $BB'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ are opposite sides
of the quadrilateral $AA'B'B$. They have the same length 
and direction. The same is true for $AB=\llt -1,3,0\rgt $ and 
$A'B'=\llt -1,3,0\rgt $. So $AA'B'B$ is a parallelogram. Because, 
$AA'\cdot AB=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt -1,3,0\rgt =-4\ne 0$, 
the neighbouring edges of $AA'B'B$ are not perpendicular and so $AA'B'B$ 
is \emph{not} a rectangle.

Similarly, the quadilateral $ACC'A'$ has opposing sides
$AA'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt =CC'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and 
$AC=\llt -1,0,4\rgt =A'C'=\llt -1,0,4\rgt $ and so is
a parallelogram. Because $AA'\cdot AC=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt -1,0,4\rgt = 0$, the neighbouring edges of $ACC'A'$ are perpendicular, so
$ACC'A'$ \emph{is} a rectangle.

Finally, the quadilateral $BCC'B'$ has opposing sides
$BB'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt =CC'=\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ and 
$BC=\llt 0,-3,4\rgt =B'C'=\llt 0,-3,4\rgt $ and so is
a parallelogram. Because $BB'\cdot BC=\llt 4,0,1\rgt \cdot\llt 0,-3,4\rgt 
= 4\ne 0$, the neighbouring edges of $BCC'B'$ are not perpendicular, so 
$BCC'B'$ is \emph{not} a rectangle.

(b) The length of $AA'$ is $|\llt 4,0,1\rgt |=\sqrt{16+1}=\sqrt{17}$.

(c) The area of a triangle is one half its base times its height. 
That is, one half times $|AB|$ times $|AC|\sin\theta$, where 
$\theta$ is the angle between $AB$ and $AC$. This is precisely 
$\half |AB\times AC|=\half|\llt -1,3,0\rgt \times\llt -1,0,4\rgt | 
=\half |\llt 12,4,3\rgt|=\frac{13}{2}$.

(d) The volume of the prism is the area of its base $ABC$,
 times its height, which is the length of $AA'$ times the cosine of the
angle between $AA'$ and the normal to $ABC$. This coincides with
$\half \llt 12,4,3\rgt \cdot\llt 4,0,1\rgt =\half(48+3)=\frac{51}{2}$, which is 
one half times the length of $\llt 12,4,3\rgt $ (the area of $ABC$) 
times the length of $\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ (the length of $AA'$) times the 
cosine of the angle between $\llt 12,4,3\rgt $ and
$\llt 4,0,1\rgt $ (the angle between the normal to $ABC$ and $AA'$).

\end{solution}",Geometry in two and three dimensions,CLP3,"

**Solution:**

**(a)** Since the opposite angles of the prism are congruent, the three faces are parallelograms.

**(b)** The length of $AA'$ can be found using the distance formula:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the vertices.

$$AA' = \sqrt{(5 - 1)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{6} \approx 2.41$$

**(c)** The area of the triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \text{base} \times \text{height}$$

The base is the length of side AB, which is 5 units, and the height is the length of AA', which is 2.41 units.

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 2.41 = 6.05$$

**(d)** The volume of the prism can be found by multiplying the area of the base by the height:

$$V = A \times h = 6.05 \times 2.41 \approx 15.2$$

**Final Answer:**

(a) The three faces are parallelograms.

(b) The length of $AA'$ is approximately 2.41 units.

(c) The area of the triangle $ABC$ is approximately 6.05 square units.

(d) The volume of the prism is approximately 15.2 cubic units."," The model's answers are incorrect for all parts of the question.
*   **Part (a):** The model's verification for parallelograms is vague and insufficient. It also completely omits checking if the faces are rectangular, which was explicitly asked.
*   **Part (b):** The model incorrectly uses a 2D distance formula, ignoring the z-coordinate. It calculates $AA' = \sqrt{(5-1)^2+(0-0)^2} = \sqrt{16}=4$, but then states $\sqrt{6} \approx 2.41$, which is a calculation error and also the wrong value. The correct length of $AA'$ is $\sqrt{(5-1)^2+(0-0)^2+(1-0)^2} = \sqrt{4^2+0^2+1^2} = \sqrt{17} \approx 4.123$.
*   **Part (c):** The model incorrectly identifies the base length of triangle ABC as 5 units (it's $\sqrt{10}$). More critically, it incorrectly uses the length of $AA'$ as the height of triangle ABC. The height of the triangle is not $AA'$. The calculation based on these incorrect assumptions is also wrong. The correct area of triangle ABC is $6.5$.
*   **Part (d):** The model uses its incorrect area from part (c) and its incorrect length of $AA'$ from part (b) to calculate the volume. While the formula ""Area of base * height"" is conceptually correct for a prism's volume, the ""height"" must be the perpendicular height between the bases, which is not necessarily the length of $AA'$ unless $AA'$ is perpendicular to the base.

**Solution:**

Let the point $P(1,2,3)$ and the points $A(0,1,1)$, $B(1,-1,3)$ and $C(2,0,-1)$.

The vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is $$\overrightarrow{AB} = \langle 1-0, -1-1, 3-1 \rangle = \langle 1, -2, 2 \rangle$$

The vector $\overrightarrow{AC}$ is $$\overrightarrow{AC} = \langle 2-1, 0-2, -1-3 \rangle = \langle 1, -2, -4 \rangle$$

The vector $\overrightarrow{BC}$ is $$\overrightarrow{BC} = \langle 1-0, -1+1, 3-1 \rangle = \langle 1, 0, 2 \rangle$$

The cross-product of these vectors is 
$$\begin{split} \overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{AC} &= \left| \begin{array}{rrr} {\bf i} & {\bf j} & {\bf k} \\\ 1 & -2 & 2 \\\ 1 & -2 & -4 \end{array} \right| \\\ & = -4 - 4 \\\ & = -8 \end{split}$$

The distance from the point $P(1,2,3)$ to the plane is equal to the absolute value of the cross-product of the vectors $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$

$$d = | \overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{AC}| = 8$$

**Final Answer: 8**"," The model's solution contains multiple severe errors:
1.  **Incorrect Vector Definition:** The vector labeled $\overrightarrow{AC}$ is calculated as $\langle 2-1, 0-2, -1-3 \rangle = \langle 1, -2, -4 \rangle$, which is actually the vector $\overrightarrow{BC}$ (vector from B to C), not $\overrightarrow{AC}$. The correct vector $\overrightarrow{AC}$ would be $\langle 2-0, 0-1, -1-1 \rangle = \langle 2, -1, -2 \rangle$.
2.  **Incorrect Cross Product Calculation:** The calculation of the cross product $\overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{AC}$ is fundamentally flawed. A cross product of two 3D vectors results in a 3D vector, not a scalar. The steps shown (`= -4 - 4 = -8`) do not represent the correct expansion of a 3x3 determinant for a cross product.
3.  **Incorrect Distance Formula:** The model claims that ""The distance from the point P(1,2,3) to the plane is equal to the absolute value of the cross-product of the vectors $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$."" This formula is completely wrong for finding the distance from a point to a plane. The magnitude of the normal vector (which is found using a cross product of two vectors in the plane) is related to the area of the parallelogram formed by those vectors, not the distance from an external point to the plane. The correct formula involves the scalar projection of a vector from a point in the plane to the external point onto the normal vector.

Due to these critical errors in vector calculation, formula application, and understanding of vector operations, the final answer of 8 is incorrect. The correct distance is 2. ",False

The model's solution for both parts (a) and (b) contains severe conceptual errors in the setup and execution of the integrals, despite arriving at the correct final numerical answer.

**Part (a) Direct Evaluation:**
The integral setup `$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 (x^2-y)(y')-y(x') \dd y \dd x$` is incorrect.
1.  A line integral `$\oint_C\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}$` is a single integral with respect to a parameter (e.g., `t`), not a double integral over `x` and `y`.
2.  The use of `y'` and `x'` without clear parameterization and the integration limits for `x` and `y` are nonsensical for the given curve.
3.  The integrand `$(x^2-y)(y')-y(x')$` does not correctly represent `$\vF\cdot \dee{\vr}$` using the given `$\vF=(x^2-y\,,\,y^2+x\,,\,1)$`. A correct setup would involve parameterizing `x, y, z` in terms of `t`, calculating `$\vF(\vr(t))\cdot \vr'(t)$`, and integrating with respect to `t`.
4.  The subsequent algebraic steps and substitutions (e.g., `$\left[ -x^2+y^2 \right]_{y=0}^{y=1}$` and `$\int_0^{2\pi} (x-1) \dd x$`) are arbitrary and do not logically follow from the problem statement or correct calculus procedures. The final answer of `2pi` is obtained through a series of incorrect steps, suggesting a lucky guess or a manipulation to match the expected result.

**Part (b) Stokes' Theorem:**
The model's application of Stokes' Theorem is fundamentally flawed.
1.  Stokes' Theorem states `$\oint_C\vF\cdot \dee{\vr} = \iint_S \operatorname{curl}\vF\cdot \dee{\vS}$`. The model incorrectly writes `$\iint_S \vF\cdot \dd {\vr}$` (using `F` instead of `curl F` and an inappropriate `dr` for a surface integral).
2.  The model then proceeds to use the exact same incorrect double integral setup from part (a) for the surface integral, `$\int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} (x^2-y)(y')-y(x') \dd y \dd x$`, which is completely irrelevant to Stokes' Theorem and physically incorrect.
3.  The mention of `dz=2y dy` is not properly integrated into a correct Stokes' Theorem calculation.

In summary, the model fails to demonstrate an understanding of how to perform a line integral directly or how to apply Stokes' Theorem. The correct final numerical answer appears to be coincidental.

(a)
By the vector identity $\vnabla\cdot\big(\vnabla\times\vG\big)=0$ 
(Theorem \eref{CLP317}{thm:degTwoIdentities}.a of the CLP-4 text).
So we must have
\begin{align*}
0&=\vnabla\cdot\vF
  =\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial x}\big(xz\big)
   + \frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial y}\big(axe^y z + byz\big)

 &= z + \big(axe^y z+bz\big) + \big(-2xe^yz\big) \\
 &= (1+b)z + (a-2)x e^y z
\end{align*}
So we need $a=2$ and $b=-1$.

(b)
Note that the boundary, $\partial S$, is the circle $x^2+y^2=1$, $z=0$,
oriented counter-clockwise. Also note that, if we knew what $\vG$ was,
we would be able to use Stokes' theorem to give
\begin{align*}

&= \dblInt_S(\vnabla\times\vG)\cdot\hn\,\dee{S}
=\oint_{\partial S} \vG\cdot\dee{\vr}

So let's find a vector potential $\vG$.
That is, let's try and find a vector field 
$\vG= G_1\,\hi + G_2\,\hj + G_3\,\hk$ that obeys $\vnabla\times\vG = \vF$,
or equivalently,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial G_3}{\partial y} -\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial z} &= F_1 
         =xz\\
-\frac{\partial G_3}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial z}&=F_2
         =2xe^y z - yz \\
\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial y}&=F_3
         =y^2 - xe^y z^2
\end{align*}
Let's also require that $G_3=0$. (If this is mysterious to you,
review \S\eref{CLP317}{sec:vectorPotential} in the CLP-4 text.)
Then the equations above simplify to
 \begin{align*}
 -\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial z} &=xz\\
  \frac{\partial G_1}{\partial z} &=2xe^y z - yz \\
\frac{\partial G_2}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial G_1}{\partial y}&=y^2 - xe^y z^2
\end{align*}
Now  the first equation contains only a single unknown, namely $G_2$ and we 
can find all $G_2$'s that obey the first equation simply by integrating 
with respect to $z$:
\begin{equation*}
G_2 = -\frac{xz^2}{2} + N(x,y)
\end{equation*}
Note that, because $\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial z}$ treats $x$ and $y$
as constants, the constant of integration $N$ is allowed to depend on $x$ 
and $y$. 

Similarly, the second equation contains only a single unknown,
$G_1$, and is easily solved by integrating with respect to $z$. 
The second equation is satisfied if and only if
\begin{equation*}
G_1 = xe^y z^2 - \frac{1}{2}yz^2 + M(x,y)
\end{equation*}
for some function $M$. 

Finally, the third equation is also satisfied
if and only if $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ obey
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial x}\Big(-\frac{xz^2}{2} + N(x,y)\Big) 
-\frac{\partial\hfill}{\partial y}\Big(xe^yz^2-\frac{yz^2}{2} + M(x,y)\Big)
     =y^2 - xe^y z^2
\end{equation*}
which simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}(x,y) -\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}(x,y) =y^2
\end{equation*}
This is one linear equation in two unknowns, $M$ and $N$. 
Typically, we can easily solve one linear equation in one unknown. 
%So we are free to eliminate one of the unknowns by setting, for example, 
%$N=0$, and then choose any $M$ that obeys
%\begin{equation*}
%-\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}(x,y) = y^2
%\end{equation*}
%Integrating with respect to $y$ gives, as one possible choice, $M(x,y) = -\frac{y^3}{3}$. So we have found a vector potential. Namely

So we are free to eliminate one of the unknowns by setting, for example, 
$M=0$, and then choosing any $N$ that obeys
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}(x,y) = y^2
\end{equation*}
Integrating with respect to $x$ gives, as one possible choice, $N(x,y) = xy^2$. So we have found a vector potential. Namely
\begin{equation*}
\vG = \Big( xe^y z^2 - \frac{1}{2}yz^2\Big)\,\hi 
       +\Big(xy^2  -\frac{xz^2}{2}\Big)\,\hj

We can now evaluate the flux. Parametrize $\partial S$
by 
\begin{align*}
\vr(\theta) & = \cos\theta\,\hi +\sin\theta\,\hj \\
\vr'(\theta) & = -\sin\theta\,\hi +\cos\theta\,\hj

**Answer:**

(a) $a = 1$ and $b = 0$.

(b) The surface integral is equal to 0.","
The model's answer for both parts (a) and (b) is incorrect.

For part (a):
The problem states that $\mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{G}$ for some differentiable vector field $\mathbf{G}$. A fundamental vector identity states that the divergence of a curl of a vector field is always zero, i.e., $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{G}) = 0$. Therefore, we must have $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0$.
Given $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = xz\,\mathbf{i} + (axe^y z + byz)\,\mathbf{j} + (y^2 - xe^y z^2 )\,\mathbf{k}$:
$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xz) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(axe^y z + byz) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(y^2 - xe^y z^2)$
$= z + (axe^y z + bz) + (-2xe^y z)$
$= (1+b)z + (a-2)xe^y z$
For $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ to be identically zero for all $x, y, z$, the coefficients of $z$ and $xe^y z$ must be zero:
$1+b = 0 \implies b = -1$
$a-2 = 0 \implies a = 2$
The gold answer correctly determines $a=2$ and $b=-1$. The model's answer of $a=1$ and $b=0$ is incorrect.

For part (b):
The problem asks to evaluate $\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS$. Since $\mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{G}$, Stokes' Theorem can be applied: $\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{G}) \cdot \mathbf{n}\,dS = \oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{G} \cdot d\mathbf{r}$.
The surface $S$ is the part of the ellipsoid $x^2 + y^2 + \frac{1}{4} z^2 = 1$ for which $z \ge 0$. The boundary $\partial S$ is the curve where $z=0$, which is $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ (a unit circle in the $xy$-plane).
To evaluate this integral, one typically needs to find a vector potential $\mathbf{G}$ such that $\nabla \times \mathbf{G} = \mathbf{F}$ (using the correct values $a=2, b=-1$). The gold answer correctly finds such a $\mathbf{G}$ (for example, $\mathbf{G} = (xe^y z^2 - \frac{1}{2}yz^2)\,\mathbf{i} + (xy^2 - \frac{xz^2}{2})\,\mathbf{j}$).
Then, the line integral is computed along the boundary $x^2+y^2=1, z=0$.
Parametrizing the boundary as $\mathbf{r}(\theta) = \cos\theta\,\mathbf{i} + \sin\theta\,\mathbf{j}$, we find $\mathbf{G}(\text{on } \partial S) = xy^2\,\mathbf{j} = \cos\theta\sin^2\theta\,\mathbf{j}$.
The integral then becomes $\int_0^{2\pi} (\cos\theta\sin^2\theta\,\mathbf{j}) \cdot (-\sin\theta\,\mathbf{i} + \cos\theta\,\mathbf{j})\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta\,d\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$.
The model's answer of 0 is incorrect. A zero result might arise from a misunderstanding of the surface (it's open, not closed) or the properties of $\mathbf{F}$.

The curl of the vector field $\vF=z\,\hi+x\,\hj-y\,\hk$ is
$$
\vnabla\times\vF=-\hi+\hj+\hk

The unit normal to the plane $x+y+z=1$, with positive $\hk$ component as
required by Stokes' theorem in this case, is $\hn=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$.
If we denote by $D$ the circular disk $x+y+z=1$, $x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1$, then 
Stokes' theorem (Theorem \eref{CLP317}{thm:Stokes} in the CLP-4 text) says

&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}{\rm Area}(D)
\end{align*}
A reasonable guess for the centre of the disk is $\frac{1}{3}(1,1,1)$. 
(This guess is just based on symmetry.) To check
this we just need to observe that it is indeed on the plane $x+y+z=1$

&=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2-\frac{2}{3}(x+y+z)+\frac{3}{9}}
=\sqrt{1-\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{3}}\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}

$\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ and hence area $\frac{2}{3}\pi$. So the specified

Instead, for both parts (a) and (b), the model attempts to find a *scalar potential* $\phi$ such that $\vnabla \phi = \vF$ (or $\vG$). This is a common but incorrect approach when a vector potential is requested.

Furthermore:
1.  **For part (a):** The gold answer correctly identifies that $\vF$ cannot have a vector potential because its divergence is non-zero ($\vnabla \cdot \vF \ne 0$). This is a necessary condition for a vector potential to exist. The model completely misses this crucial initial test and proceeds with an incorrect method.
2.  **For both parts (a) and (b):** The condition $A_3=0$ (meaning the k-component of the vector potential $\vA$ is zero) is completely misapplied by the model. It attempts to relate it to the arbitrary function of integration ($g(y,z)$) when finding a scalar potential, which makes no mathematical sense in this context. The condition $A_3=0$ constrains the form of the vector potential $\vA$, not a scalar potential.

**Solution:**

The washers are formed by rotating the region $R$ about the $y$-axis. The radius of each washer is equal to the distance from the $y$-axis to the curve of $y=f(x)$ at that point. The thickness of each washer is equal to the length of the arc of the curve of $y=f(x)$ between the points (1,1) and (4,3).

Therefore, the total area of the washers is:

Evaluate $\displaystyle\int\left(\frac{3}{x^2+2}+\frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}\right)
~\dee{x}
$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Our integrand is already in the nice form that would come out of a partial fractions decomposition.
Let's consider its different pieces.
\begin{itemize}
\item First piece: $\int \frac{3}{x^2+2}~\dee{x}$. The  fraction looks somewhat like the derivative of arctangent, so we can massage it to find an appropriate substitution.

\begin{align*}
\int \frac{3}{x^2+2}~\dee{x}&=\frac{3}{2}\int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt2}\right)^2+1}~\dee{x}

&=\frac{3}{\sqrt2}\arctan u+C\\
&=\frac{3}{\sqrt2}\arctan \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt2}\right)+C
\end{align*}

\item The next piece is $\int \frac{x-3}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}$.
If the numerator were only $x$ (and no constant), we could use the substitution $u=x^2+2$, $\dee{u} = 2x~\dee{x}$. So, to that end, we can break up that fraction into $\frac{x}{(x^2+2)^2}-\frac{3}{(x^2+2)^2}$. For now, we only evaluate the first half.

\begin{align*}
\int \frac{x}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}&=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{1}{u^2}~\dee{u} = -\frac{1}{2u}+C\\
&=-\frac{1}{2x^2+4}+C
\end{align*}

\item That leaves us with the final piece, $\frac{3}{(x^2+2)^2}$,  which is the hardest. We saw something similar in  Question~\ref{prob_s1.9:forpartialfractions} in Section 1.9: we can use the substitution $x=\sqrt{2}\tan\theta$, $\dee{x} = \sqrt{2}\sec^2\theta~\dee{\theta}$.
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{3}{(x^2+2)^2}~\dee{x}&=\int\frac{3}{(2\tan^2\theta+2)^2}\sqrt{2}\sec^2\theta~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\int\frac{3}{4\sec^4\theta}\sqrt{2}\sec^2\theta~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}\int\cos^2\theta~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\int\big(1+\cos(2\theta)\big)~\dee{\theta}\\
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\left(\theta+\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)\right)+C\\
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\left(\theta+\sin\theta\cos\theta\right)+C\\
\smash{\trigtri{\theta}{\sqrt2}{x}{\sqrt{x^2+2}}}\hspace{2cm}
&=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{2}}\left(\arctan\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt2}\right)+\frac{x\sqrt{2}}{x^2+2}\right)+C
\end{align*}
From our substitution, $\tan\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt2}$. So, we can draw a right triangle with angle $\theta$, opposite side $x$, and adjacent side $\sqrt2$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{x^2+2}$, and this gives us $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$.

1.  **Incorrect Intersection Points:** The points of intersection are $x=0$ and $x=2$ (giving $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$), not $x=0$ and $x=3$ (which would give $(0,0)$ and $(3,0)$ for $y=3x-x^2$, and $(3,3)$ for $y=x$). The model incorrectly states $(3,9)$ as an intersection point.
2.  **Incorrect Limits of Integration:** Due to the incorrect intersection points, the limits of integration are incorrectly set to $0$ to $3$ instead of $0$ to $2$.
3.  **Incorrect Integrand:** For the region between $x=0$ and $x=2$, the curve $y=3x-x^2$ is above the line $y=x$. Therefore, the integrand should be $(3x-x^2)-x = 2x-x^2$. The model uses $(x)-(3x-x^2) = x^2-2x$, which is the negative of the correct integrand.

5.  **Incorrect Evaluation:** Even if following the model's incorrect antiderivative $[x^2-x^3]_0^3$ with its incorrect limits $[0,3]$, the evaluation would be $(3^2-3^3)-(0^2-0^3) = (9-27)-0 = -18$. The model's final answer of $9$ does not even match its own derived incorrect steps.

The integrand is positive everywhere. So either the integral
converges to some finite number or it is infinite. There are two potential
``sources of impropriety'' --- a possible singularity at $x=0$ and
the fact that the domain of integration extends to $\infty$.

Since the improper integral converges, the original integral is convergent."," The model's final answer, ""convergent"", matches the gold answer's conclusion. However, the reasoning provided by the model is entirely incorrect and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of integral calculus, specifically improper integrals and substitutions.

Here are the critical errors in the model's reasoning:
1.  **Incorrect Substitution Application**: When applying the substitution $u = \frac{1}{x}$, the integrand $\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}$ and the differential $dx$ must be transformed correctly. The integral becomes $\int_0^\infty \sin^4\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\, du$, not $\int_0^\infty \sin^4 u\, du$. The model incorrectly equates these.
2.  **Incorrect Antiderivative**: The antiderivative of $\sin^4 u$ is not $\frac{1}{3}\sin^3 u$. This is a basic error in integration.
3.  **Incorrect Convergence Determination**: Even if the integral was $\int_0^\infty \sin^4 u\, du$, it would diverge because the integrand $\sin^4 u$ does not approach zero as $u \to \infty$. It oscillates between 0 and 1, meaning the area under the curve continuously accumulates.

The area is negative. The shape is a trapezoid with base length $(b - a)$ and heights

Since $f(x)$ is linear, there exist real numbers $m$ and $c$ such that $f(x)=mx+c$. Now we can do some calculations. Suppose we have a rectangle in our Riemann sum that takes up the interval $[x,x+w]$.

let the rectangles in the left Riemann sum have areas $\textcolor{blue}{L_1,L_2,\ldots,L_n}$, and
let the rectangles in the right Riemann sum have areas $\textcolor{red}{R_1,R_2,\ldots,R_n}$. Then the midpoint Riemann sum evaluates to $M_1+M_2+\cdots+M_n$, and:

Show that there exists at least one real number $c$ such that $2\tan(c)=c+1$.

We let $f(x)=2\tan(x)-x-1$. Then $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the interval $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ since $\tan(x)=\sin(x)/\cos(x)$ is continuous on this interval, while $x+1$ is a polynomial and therefore continuous for all real numbers.

We find a value $a\in (-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ such that $f(a)<0$. We observe immediately that $a=0$ works since
$$f(0)=2\tan(0)-0-1=0-1=-1<0.$$

We find a value $b\in (-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ such that $f(b)>0$. We see that $b=\pi/4$ works since
$$f(\pi/4)=2\tan(\pi/4) -\pi/4 - 1=2-\pi/4 - 1=1-\pi/4=(4-\pi)/4>0,$$
because $3<\pi<4$.

So, because $f(x)$ is continuous on $[0,\pi/4]$ and $f(0)<0$ while $f(\pi/4)>0$, then the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a real number $c\in (0,\pi/4)$ such that $f(c)=0$.

However, the model claims it equals $\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi$, which is incorrect.
2.  **Unjustified Conclusion:** The statement ""$2\tan(c)=\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi$"" is not derived from the original equation $2\tan(c)=c+1$ or any valid mathematical step.
3.  **Flawed Range Analysis:** If $c = \frac{\pi}{4}+n\pi$ and $0 \le c \le \pi$, then $0 \le \frac{\pi}{4}+n\pi \le \pi$, which implies $-\frac{1}{4} \le n \le \frac{3}{4}$. The only integer value for $n$ is $0$. This means $c=\frac{\pi}{4}$. However, $c=\frac{\pi}{4}$ is not a solution to the original equation since $2\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}) = 2$ but $\frac{\pi}{4}+1 \approx 0.785+1 = 1.785$. So $2 \ne \frac{\pi}{4}+1$.

**Solution:**

The minimum of the function is attained at the boundary of the domain. Since $x^2 + y^2 \le 1$, the minimum will occur at the boundary points.

At the boundary points, we have:

$$h(x,y) = -4x - 2y + 6$$

$$-4 = -2$$

$$y = 2$$

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:

$$h(x,y) = -4x + 4 = 0$$

Therefore, the minimum of the function is 0, attained at the point $(0, 2)$."," The model's reasoning is fundamentally flawed.
1.  The statement ""Setting the partial derivatives to zero, we get: $-4 = -2$"" is incorrect. The partial derivatives of $h(x,y) = -4x - 2y + 6$ are $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = -4$ and $\frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = -2$. Setting these to zero gives $-4=0$ and $-2=0$, which are impossible, indicating no critical points in the interior. The model's manipulation is nonsensical.
2.  The deduction ""y = 2"" is arbitrary and not derived from any valid mathematical step.
3.  The model then incorrectly calculates $h(x,y)$ after substituting $y=2$ (it should be $-4x+2$, not $-4x+4$).
4.  The final answer of 0 at $(0,2)$ is incorrect. First, $(0,2)$ is outside the domain $x^2+y^2 \le 1$ ($0^2+2^2 = 4 > 1$). Second, even if it were in the domain, $h(0,2) = -4(0) - 2(2) + 6 = 2$, not 0.

Even if we were to solve the system provided by the model ($2x - 20y = 0$ and $2x - 2y = 0$), the only solution is $(0,0)$, not $(2,0)$ and $(-2,0)$ as stated by the model. The model's calculation of critical points is internally inconsistent with its own (incorrect) partial derivatives.
3.  **Missing Classification:** The model fails to classify the critical points, which is a required part of the question.

For part (b):
1.  **Incorrect Absolute Minimum:** The model claims the absolute minimum is at $(2,0)$. While $(2,0)$ is in the region, $g(2,0) = 2^2 - 10(0) - 0^2 = 4$. The actual absolute minimum value is $0$, occurring at $(0,0)$, which is also in the region ($g(0,0)=0$).
2.  **Incomplete Approach:** The model's reasoning for part (b) is insufficient. Finding absolute extrema on a bounded region requires checking critical points within the region and systematically evaluating the function along all segments of the boundary. The model does neither effectively.

By definition, the differential at $x=a$, $y=b$ is
\begin{equation*}
f_x(a,b)\,\dee{x} + f_y(a,b)\,\dee{y}
\end{equation*}
so we have to determine the partial derivatives $f_x(a,b)$ and $f_y(a,b)$.
We are told that
\begin{equation*}
e^{f(x,y)} + y\,f(x,y) = x + y
\end{equation*}
for all $x$ and $y$.
Differentiating this equation with respect to $x$
and with respect to $y$ gives, by the chain rule,
\begin{align*}
e^{f(x,y)}f_x(x,y) + y\,f_x(x,y) = 1 \\
e^{f(x,y)}f_y(x,y) + f(x,y) +y\,f_y(x,y) = 1

Solving the first equation for $f_x$ and the second for $f_y$ gives
\begin{align*}
f_x(x,y) &=  \frac{1}{e^{f(x,y)}+y} \\
f_y(x,y) &= \frac{1-f(x,y)}{e^{f(x,y)}+y}

So the differential at $x=a$, $y=b$ is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\dee{x}}{e^{f(a,b)}+b} + \frac{1-f(a,b)}{e^{f(a,b)}+b} \,\dee{y}

Since we can't solve explicitly for $f(a,b)$ for general $a$ and $b$.
There's not much more that we can do with this. 

(b) In particular, when $a=1$ and $b=0$, we have 
\begin{equation*}
e^{f(1,0)} + 0\,f(1,0) = 1 + 0
\implies 
e^{f(1,0)}  = 1 
\implies 
f(1,0)=0

\begin{equation*}
f\big(1+\dee{x}\,,\,\dee{y}\big)
  \approx f(1,0) + \frac{\dee{x}}{e^{f(1,0)}+0} 
        + \frac{1-f(1,0)}{e^{f(1,0)}+0}   \,\dee{y}
  = \dee{x} +\dee{y}

**Solution:**

**(a)** The differential of $z$ is given by:

$$\dee{z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} [ \ln(e^z + yz) - \ln(x + y)] dx + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} [ \ln(e^z + yz) - \ln(x + y)] dy.$$

**(b)** At the point $(1,0)$, we have:

$$\dee{z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} [ \ln(e^z + 1 \cdot 0) - \ln(1 + 0)] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} [ \ln(e^z + 1 \cdot 0) - \ln(1 + 0)] = 0.$$

Therefore, the linear approximation of $f(0.99,0.01)$ is:

$$f(0.99,0.01) \approx f(1,0) + \dee{z} (0.01) = 1 + 0 = 1.$$","
The model's answer is incorrect for both parts (a) and (b).

**Part (a): Find the differential dz.**
The model provides an incorrect formula for the differential. The differential $dz$ should be $dz = f_x dx + f_y dy$, where $f_x$ and $f_y$ are the partial derivatives of $z$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, respectively, obtained via implicit differentiation. The model's expression involving logarithms is fundamentally incorrect for finding the differential of an implicitly defined function.

**Part (b): Use linear approximation at the point (1,0) to approximate $f(0.99,0.01)$.**
1.  **Value of f(1,0):** The model states $f(1,0)=1$. This is incorrect. Substituting $(x,y)=(1,0)$ into $e^z + yz = x + y$ gives $e^{f(1,0)} + 0 \cdot f(1,0) = 1+0$, which simplifies to $e^{f(1,0)} = 1$. This implies $f(1,0)=0$.
2.  **Differential calculation:** The model incorrectly states $\dee{z} = 0$ at the point $(1,0)$. The differential is a linear combination of $dx$ and $dy$, not a scalar value of 0. Furthermore, the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ at $(1,0)$ are non-zero. (From Gold: $f_x(1,0)=1$ and $f_y(1,0)=1$).
3.  **Linear Approximation Formula:** The model's application of the linear approximation formula $f(0.99,0.01) \approx f(1,0) + \dee{z} (0.01)$ is conceptually flawed. The correct formula is $L(x,y) = f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$, or in differential notation, $f(a+\Delta x, b+\Delta y) \approx f(a,b) + \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}|_{(a,b)}\Delta x + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}|_{(a,b)}\Delta y$.
4.  **Final Answer:** Due to these errors, the model's final approximation of $f(0.99,0.01) \approx 1+0=1$ is incorrect. The gold answer correctly finds it to be $0$.

Let \(A, B, \) and \(C\) be the three thermodynamic properties of a system: energy \(E\), entropy \(S\), and volume \(V\). Then the determinant of the following matrix is equal to -1:

**Solution:**

Let's consider the following change of variables:
$$s = x - t \quad \text{ and } \quad t = x + t.$$

Then, the new variables satisfy the following relations:

$$x = \frac{s + t}{2} \quad \text{ and } \quad y = \frac{s - t}{2}.$$

Substituting these variables into the Laplace equation, we get:

$$\begin{split} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\left[ f(x,y) \right] + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}[f(x,y)] \\\ & = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[f(x,y)] \right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial y}[f(x,y)] \right] \\\ & = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ -f(x,y) \right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}[f(x,y)] \\\ & = 0. \end{split}$$

Therefore, we have shown that $\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial s^2} + \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial t^2} = 0$."," The model's solution is fundamentally flawed from the beginning.
1.  **Incorrect Variable Transformation:** The problem defines $g(s,t) = f(s-t, s+t)$, which implies that the new coordinates are $x = s-t$ and $y = s+t$. The model states `s = x - t` and `t = x + t`, which is not only incorrect but also nonsensical (e.g., `t = x + t` implies `x = 0`). It then proceeds to derive `x = (s+t)/2` and `y = (s-t)/2`, which is the inverse transformation for a different substitution ($s=x+y, t=x-y$ or similar), not the one given in the problem. The correct transformation for the given problem is $x=s-t$ and $y=s+t$.
2.  **Incorrect Application of Derivatives/Laplace Equation:** The model's subsequent steps, particularly the line `& = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ -f(x,y) \right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}[f(x,y)]`, are mathematically meaningless in the context of transforming a differential equation. It does not apply the chain rule for multivariable functions to calculate the partial derivatives of $g$ with respect to $s$ and $t$, which is the necessary method to solve this problem.
3.  **No Derivation:** The model completely fails to calculate $\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial s^2}$ and $\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial t^2}$ and sum them as required. It simply rewrites the given condition for $f(x,y)$ in a nonsensical way and then asserts the final result without any derivation.

(b) 
Think of $x=u^3-3uv^2$, $y=3u^2v-v^3$ as two equations in the two 
    unknowns $u$, $v$ with $x$, $y$ just being given parameters. The
    question implicitly tells us that those two equations can be solved
    for $u$, $v$ in terms of $x$, $y$, at least near
    $(u,v)=(2,1)$, $(x,y)=(2,11)$. That is, the question implicitly
    tells us that the functions $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are determined by
\begin{equation*}
x=u(x,y)^3-3u(x,y)\,v(x,y)^2\qquad
y=3u(x,y)^2v(x,y)-v(x,y)^3
\end{equation*}
Applying $\pdiff{}{x}$ to both sides of the equation
$x=u(x,y)^3-3u(x,y)v(x,y)^2$ gives
\begin{align*}
1&=3\,u(x,y)^2\,\pdiff{u}{x}(x,y)

       -6\,u(x,y)\,v(x,y)\,\pdiff{v}{x}(x,y) \\[0.05in]
\end{align*}
Then applying $\pdiff{}{x}$ to both sides of $y=3u(x,y)^2v(x,y)-v(x,y)^3$ gives
\begin{align*}
0&=6\,u(x,y)\,\pdiff{u}{x}(x,y)\,v(x,y)
   +3\,u(x,y)^2\,\pdiff{v}{x}(x,y)
   -3\,v(x,y)^2\,\pdiff{v}{x}(x,y)

Substituting in $x=2$, $y=11$, $u=2$, $v=1$ gives
\begin{alignat*}{3}
1&=12\pdiff{u}{x}(2,11)

&&=12\pdiff{u}{x}(2,11)
   +9\pdiff{v}{x}(2,11)
\end{alignat*}
From the second equation $\pdiff{v}{x}(2,11)
=-\frac{4}{3}\pdiff{u}{x}(2,11)$. Substituting into the

so that $\pdiff{u}{x}(2,11)=\frac{1}{25}$
and $\pdiff{v}{x}(2,11)=-\frac{4}{75}$.
The question also tells us that $z(x,y)=u(x,y)^2-v(x,y)^2$.
Hence
\begin{align*}
&\pdiff{z}{x}(x,y)

**Final Answer:** (a) The function \(w(x,y)=e^{-y}f(x-y)\) is a solution to the partial differential equation.

(b) $\pdiff{z}{x}=2u$. At the point $(u,v)=(2,1)$, we have \(z=u^2-v^2=4-1=3\), so $\pdiff{z}{x}=2(2)=4$.","
Part (a): The question asks to ""show that"" the function satisfies the PDE. The model's answer merely states that it is a solution, without providing any of the necessary steps or derivations. This does not fulfill the requirement of ""showing"".

Part (b): The model's calculation for $\pdiff{z}{x}$ is incorrect.
The chain rule for $z(x,y)$ (where $u$ and $v$ are functions of $x$ and $y$) is $\pdiff{z}{x} = \pdiff{z}{u}\pdiff{u}{x} + \pdiff{z}{v}\pdiff{v}{x}$.
Given $z=u^2-v^2$, we have $\pdiff{z}{u}=2u$ and $\pdiff{z}{v}=-2v$.
So, $\pdiff{z}{x} = 2u\pdiff{u}{x} - 2v\pdiff{v}{x}$.
The model incorrectly assumes $\pdiff{z}{x} = 2u$, which implies that $\pdiff{u}{x}=1$ and $\pdiff{v}{x}=0$, or that $v$ is not a function of $x$, both of which are incorrect in this context. The values of $\pdiff{u}{x}$ and $\pdiff{v}{x}$ must be determined by implicit differentiation of the given equations for $x$ and $y$ with respect to $x$. The gold solution correctly performs these steps, leading to $\pdiff{z}{x} = \frac{4}{15}$ at the given point, while the model's answer is $4$.

- The gold normal line is $\llt x,y,z\rgt=\llt -2,1,3\rgt+t\llt 4,2,1\rgt$. The model's normal line $y=-x+1$ is an equation of a line in 2D or a plane in 3D, not a 3D line normal to the surface. It is incorrect.

For part (b):
- The gold tangent plane is $2y-z=-1$. The model's tangent plane $xye' + y^2e^{xy}=0$ is not a valid equation for a plane and contains undefined notation ($e'$). It is incorrect.
- The gold normal line is $\llt x,y,z\rgt=\llt 2,0,1\rgt+t\llt 0,2,-1\rgt$. The model's normal line $y=0$ is an equation of a plane, not a 3D line. It is incorrect.

Let $S$ be the surface $z = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y - 1$. Find all points 
$P (x_0,y_0,z_0)$ on $S$ with $x_0 \ne 0$ such that the normal line 
at $P$ contains the origin $(0,0,0)$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
The equation of $S$ is of the form $G(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y-z = 1$.
So one normal vector to $S$ at the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is 
\begin{equation*}
\vnabla G(x_0,y_0,z_0)  = 2x_0\,\hi + (4y_0+2)\,\hj -\hk
\end{equation*}
and the normal line to $S$ at $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is
\begin{equation*}
(x,y,z) = (x_0,y_0,z_0) +t\llt 2x_0\,,\,4y_0+2\,,\, -1\rgt
\end{equation*}
For this normal line to pass through the origin, there must be a $t$
with
\begin{align*}
(0,0,0) = (x_0,y_0,z_0) +t\llt 2x_0\,,\,4y_0+2\,,\, -1\rgt
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
x_0 + 2x_0\,t & =0 \tag{E1}\\
y_0 +(4y_0+2)t &=0 \tag{E2}\\
z_0 -t &=0 \tag{E3}
\end{align*}
Equation (E3) forces $t=z_0$. Substituting this into equations (E1) and (E2)
gives
\begin{align*}
x_0(1+2z_0) & =0 \tag{E1}\\
y_0 +(4y_0+2)z_0 &=0 \tag{E2}
\end{align*}
The question specifies that $x_0\ne 0$, so (E1) forces $z_0=-\frac{1}{2}$.
Substituting $z_0=-\frac{1}{2}$ into (E2) gives
\begin{equation*}
-y_0-1=0 \implies y_0=-1
\end{equation*}
Finally $x_0$ is determined by the requirement that $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$
must lie on $S$ and so must obey
\begin{equation*}
z_0 = x_0^2 + 2y_0^2 + 2y_0 - 1
\implies -\frac{1}{2} = x_0^2 + 2(-1)^2 +2(-1)-1
\implies x_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}
%\implies x_0 = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}

  $\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,-1\,,\,-\frac{1}{2}\big)$
and 
  $\big(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,,\,-1\,,\,-\frac{1}{2}\big)$.

**Solution:**

Since the normal line at $P$ contains the origin, the gradient vector of the surface must be parallel to the z-axis. This means that the gradient vector must be tangent to the surface at $P$.

$$\nabla S(x,y,z) = 4x {\bf i} + 4y {\bf j} + {\bf k}$$

At the point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, the gradient vector is:

$$\nabla S(x_0,y_0,z_0) = 4x_0 {\bf i} + 4y_0 {\bf j} + {\bf k}$$

Since the normal line at $P$ contains the origin, we have:

$$4x_0 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_0 = 0$$

$$4y_0 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y_0 = 0$$

Therefore, $P(0,0,z_0)$ is the only point on $S$ with $x_0 \ne 0$ that lies on the normal line at $P$.

Since $z_0$ is arbitrary, we have $z_0 = 1$.

So, the only point on $S$ with $x_0 \ne 0$ that lies on the normal line at $P$ is $P(0,0,1)$."," The model's solution contains multiple fundamental errors:
1.  **Incorrect Gradient Calculation:** The surface is given by $z = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y - 1$. If we define $F(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y - z - 1 = 0$, the gradient (normal vector) should be $\nabla F = \langle 2x, 4y+2, -1 \rangle$. The model calculates the gradient as $\langle 4x, 4y, 1 \rangle$, which is incorrect.
2.  **Misinterpretation of Condition:** The statement ""Since the normal line at P contains the origin, the gradient vector of the surface must be parallel to the z-axis"" is incorrect. If the normal line at $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ contains the origin, it means the position vector $\langle x_0,y_0,z_0 \rangle$ is parallel to the normal vector at $P$. This means $\langle x_0,y_0,z_0 \rangle = t \cdot \nabla F(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ for some scalar $t$.
3.  **Contradiction of Problem Constraint:** The problem explicitly states $x_0 \ne 0$. However, the model's incorrect logic leads to $x_0 = 0$, which directly violates this constraint.
4.  **Incorrect Point Calculation:** Even if we were to follow the model's incorrect gradient and logic, setting $4x_0=0$ and $4y_0=0$ leads to $x_0=0, y_0=0$. For a point $P(0,0,z_0)$ to be on the surface, $z_0 = 0^2 + 2(0)^2 + 2(0) - 1 = -1$. The model then arbitrarily states $z_0=1$, and the final point $P(0,0,1)$ is not even on the given surface (since $1 \ne -1$).

The gold answer correctly calculates the gradient, sets up the vector equation for the normal line containing the origin, and systematically solves for the points while respecting the $x_0 \ne 0$ condition. ",False

**Question:**

Find all functions $u(x,y)$ that obey the following partial differential equation:

$$u_x + u_y = 0$$

**Answer:**

**(a)** For the first part, consider the function:

$$u(x,y) = \sin(x) \cos(y)$$

Then,

$$u_x = -\cos(x) \cos(y)$$

$$u_y = \cos(x) \sin(y)$$

Substituting these into the PDE, we get:

$$-\cos(x) \cos(y) + \cos(x) \sin(y) = 0$$

which holds for all $(x,y)$.

**(b)** For the second part, let $f(x)$ be a given function. Then,

$$u(x,y) = f(x)e^{-y}$$

Then,

$$u_x(x,y) = f'(x)e^{-y}$$

Substituting this into the PDE, we get:

$$f'(x)e^{-y} - f(x)e^{-y} = f(x)e^{-y}$$

2.  For part (a), the model attempts to verify a specific function $u(x,y) = \sin(x) \cos(y)$ against its *misinterpreted* PDE ($u_x + u_y = 0$). Even for that wrong PDE, its calculation of $u_x$ is incorrect (it should be $\cos(x)\cos(y)$, not $-\cos(x)\cos(y)$ as stated by the model). Furthermore, the function does not satisfy the *original* PDE $u_x=0$ (since $\cos(x)\cos(y) \neq 0$ generally), nor does it satisfy the model's own stated PDE. The model also fails to find *all* functions, as requested by the prompt.
3.  For part (b), the model proposes $u(x,y) = f(x)e^{-y}$ and then performs a substitution into an equation that does not correspond to the original PDE $u_x(x,y)=f(x)$.

The model incorrectly used the constraint function as its primary term and a linear term in z as part of its Lagrange function: $L(x, y, z, \lambda) = (z^2 + x^2 + y^2 - 2y - 10) + \lambda(z - 1)$. This setup is completely wrong.

2.  The ""corresponding characteristic equation"" $(x + y)^2 = 4(x^2 - 5y^2)$ is mathematically unfounded and irrelevant to the problem of finding closest/farthest points using standard methods (like Lagrange multipliers or rotating axes).
3.  Setting ""each component to zero"" as $x+y=0$ and $x^2-5y^2=0$ is a severe misunderstanding of how to solve equations or quadratic forms.
4.  Solving the system $x+y=0$ and $x^2-5y^2=0$ leads to $x=0, y=0$, not $x=3, y=-3$.

	Zipf's Law applied to word frequency can be phrased as follows:

		The most-used word in a language is used $n$ times as frequently as the $n$-th most word used in a language.
	\end{quote}

	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Suppose the sequence $\{w_1,w_2,w_3,\ldots\}$ is a list of all words in a language, where $w_n$ is the word that is the $n$th most frequently used. Let $f_n$ be the frequency of word $w_n$. Is $\{f_1,f_2,f_3,\ldots\}$ an increasing sequence or a decreasing sequence?
		\item Give a general formula for $f_n$, treating $f_1$ as a constant.
		\item Suppose in a language, $w_1$ (the most frequently used word) has frequency 6\%. If the language follows Zipf's Law, then what frequency does $w_3$ have?
		\item Suppose $f_6=0.3\%$ for a language following Zipf's law. What is $f_{10}$?
		\item The word ``the"" is the most-used word in contemporary American English. In a collection of about 450 million words, ``the"" appeared 22,038,615 times. The second-most used word is ``be,"" followed by ``and."" About how many usages of these words do you expect in the same collection of 450 million words?
		%\item Mandelbrot proposed a variation on Zipf's law, that $f_n\approx\dfrac{f_1}{n+2.7}$. The 450-million-word source material that used ``the"" 22,038,615 times also contained 12,545,825 instances of ``be,"" and 10,741,073 instances of ``and."" Do these frequencies more closely follow Zipf's law, or Mandelbrot's?

\end{question}","\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Since $w_1$ has the highest frequency, $w_2$ has the next-highest frequency, and so on, we know $f_1$ is larger than the other members of its sequence, $f_2$ is the next largest, etc. So, $\{f_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence.
		\item The most-used word in a language is $w_1$, while the $n$-th most used word in a language is $w_n$. So, we re-state the law as:
		\[f_1=nf_n\] Then we can rewrite this fomula a little more naturally as $f_n=\frac{1}{n}f_1$.
		\item Then $f_3=\frac{1}{3}f_1$. In this case, we expect the third-most used word to account for  $\frac{1}{3}(6\%) = 2\%$ of all words.
		\item From (b), we know $f_{10}=\frac{1}{10}f_1$. Note $f_1=6f_6=6(0.3\%)$. Then:
		\[f_{10}=\frac{1}{10}f_1 = \frac{1}{10}6f_6=\frac{1}{10}(6)(0.3\%)=\frac{1.8}{10}\%=0.18\%\]
		So, $f_{10}$ should be 0.18\% of all words.
		\item The use of the word ``frequency"" in the statement of Zipf's law implies $f_n = \frac{\text{uses of $w_n$}}{\text{total number of words}}$. The question asks for the total uses of $w_n$. If we call this quantity $t_n$, and the total number of all words is $T$, then Zipf's law tells us $\frac{t_n}{T}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{t_1}{T}$, hence $t_n=\frac{1}{n}t_1$.

		With this notation, the problem states $t_1=22,038,615$, $w_1=\texttt{the}$, $w_2=\texttt{be}$, and  $w_3=\texttt{and}$.

		Following Zipf's law, $t_n=\frac1nt_1$. So, we expect $t_2=\frac{t_1}{2} = 11,019,307.5$; since this isn't an integer, let's say we expect $t_2\approx 11,019,308$. Similarly, we expect
		$t_3=\frac{t_1}{3} = 7,346,205$.

		Remark: The 450-million-word source material that used ``the"" 22,038,615 times also contained 12,545,825 instances of ``be,"" and 10,741,073 instances of ``and."" While Zipf's Law might be a nice model for our data overall, in these few instances it does not appear to be extremely accurate.

	%	$f_3=\frac{f_1}{3+2.7}\approx 3,866,424$. Both Zipf and Mandelbrot predict frequencies of ``be"" and ``and"" that are smaller than the actual usage in our sample, but Mandelbrot's prediction is \emph{even smaller than} Zipf's. So, we might reasonably say that Zipf's law fits better in this case.

**Final Answer:** The sequence $\{f_1,f_2,f_3,\ldots\}$ is a decreasing sequence.

The model's answer is incorrect because:
1.  **Part (b) Formula:** The model provides the formula $f_n=\frac{f_1}{n+2.7}$. This is Mandelbrot's variation of Zipf's law, not Zipf's law itself, which is defined in the problem statement as $f_1 = n f_n$ (leading to $f_n = \frac{f_1}{n}$). The question specifically asks for a formula based on Zipf's Law as phrased.
2.  **Part (c) Omission:** The model completely omitted the answer for part (c).
3.  **Part (d) Calculation:** The model provides $f_{10}=0.0003\%$. Using Zipf's law ($f_n = f_1/n$), if $f_6=0.3\%$, then $f_1 = 6 \times 0.3\% = 1.8\%$. Consequently, $f_{10} = f_1/10 = 1.8\%/10 = 0.18\%$. The model's answer is numerically incorrect. Even if the model used its own incorrect formula from part (b) ($f_n=\frac{f_1}{n+2.7}$), the calculation would be: $f_1 = f_6 \times (6+2.7) = 0.3\% \times 8.7 = 2.61\%$. Then $f_{10} = \frac{f_1}{10+2.7} = \frac{2.61\%}{12.7} \approx 0.2055\%$. Neither derivation leads to $0.0003\%$.
4.  **Part (e) Omission:** The model completely omitted the answer for part (e).

While part (a) is correct, the significant errors in understanding the core law (part b), calculation errors (part d), and substantial omissions (parts c and e) lead to an overall incorrect evaluation.

**Solution:**

Let \(u = x^2\). Then \(du = 2x \ dx\), and \(x dx = \frac{1}{2} du\). Substituting, we get

$$\begin{split} I &= \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^2 e^{-x^2}\ \dee{x} \\\ & = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\frac{1}{4}} u e^{-u}\ du \\\ & = \left[ -e^{-u} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{4}} \\\ & = \frac{1}{4}. \end{split} $$"," The model's approach is flawed from the beginning.
1.  **Incorrect Substitution:** The substitution $u = x^2$ leads to $du = 2x \, dx$. The integral is $\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^2 e^{-x^2}\ \dee{x}$. To perform the substitution, one would need $x \, dx$. If we rewrite the integrand as $x \cdot (x e^{-x^2}) \, dx$, it doesn't simplify easily. If the model intended to convert $x^2 \, dx$ directly, then $dx = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}} du$, leading to $\int u e^{-u} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}} du = \frac{1}{2} \int \sqrt{u} e^{-u} du$. The model's form $\frac{1}{2} \int u e^{-u} du$ is incorrect, as it assumes $x^2 dx = u \cdot \frac{1}{2} du$, which is not true for the original integrand. This suggests a misunderstanding of how to apply substitution in this context.
2.  **Incorrect Integration:** Even if the integral $\frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\frac{1}{4}} u e^{-u} du$ were the correct one to solve, the model's evaluation of this integral is incorrect. The integral $\int u e^{-u} du$ requires integration by parts, yielding $-(u+1)e^{-u}$. The model's result $\left[ -e^{-u} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{4}}$ implies it treated the integrand as $e^{-u}$ or made a significant error in applying integration by parts.
3.  **Numerical Error:** The final step where the model states $1 - e^{-1/4} = \frac{1}{4}$ is also numerically incorrect. $1 - e^{-1/4} \approx 1 - 0.7788 = 0.2212$, which is not $0.25$.

The gold answer correctly uses a Taylor series expansion to approximate the integral, providing an interval of the required length. The model's final answer of $1/4$ (or $0.25$) is vastly different from the gold answer's interval, which is approximately $[0.035920, 0.035995]$. ",False

The model's answer for part (a) is incorrect because it only states the Maclaurin series rather than ""showing"" or deriving it, as requested by the question. A ""show that"" question requires the derivation steps, which are completely absent.

For part (b), while the final conclusion (series converges for all $x$) is correct, the steps shown for the ratio test are fundamentally flawed:
1.  The limit variable is incorrectly stated as $x \to \infty$ instead of $n \to \infty$.
2.  The expression inside the limit, `$\left| \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)\cdot (n+1)!} x^n \right|$`, is not the correct ratio $\left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right|$. It appears to be an incorrect modification of $a_{n+1}$, and crucially, it misses the division by $a_n$ and the simplification of the $x$ terms.
3.  The calculation of the limit is omitted, and the statement that this incorrect expression equals 0 is asserted without justification for how it relates to the actual ratio test calculation involving $|x|$.

Therefore, the reasoning for part (b) is incorrect and incomplete, despite reaching the correct final conclusion.

	(That is, an absolute error less than $5\times10^{-11}$.)

	You may assume without proof that $2<e<3$.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
	We'll use  Theorem~\eref{CLP101}{eq:TaylorPolyPlusError_b} in the CLP-2 text to bound the error of a partial-sum approximation. The error in the partial-sum approximation $S_N$ is
	\[E_N=\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}\]
	for some $c$ strictly between $a$ and $x$. In our case, $a=0$ and $x$ is in $(-2,1)$. So, we want to find a value of $N$ such that
	\[\left|\frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!}\left(x\right)^{N+1}\right|<5\times 10^{-11}\]
	for \emph{all} $x$ in $(-2,1)$, and \emph{all} $c$ in $(-2,1)$.

	To find this $N$, we to know $f^{(N+1)}(x)$. Just like when we create a Taylor polynomial from scratch, we'll differentiate $f(x)$ several times, and look for a pattern.

\begin{align*}
f(x)=\sinh(x)&=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\
f'(x)&=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}\\
f''(x)&=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\\
f'''(x)&=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}
\end{align*}
That is, even derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f(x)$, and odd derivatives of $f(x)$ are $\frac{{e^x}+e^{-x}}{2}$ (which, incidentally, is the function called $\cosh x$).

	Now we want a reasonable bound on $f^{(N+1)}(c)$, when $c$ is in $(-2,1)$. Since powers of $e$ are always positive, we begin by noting that $0<\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}<\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$. So, all derivatives of $f(x)$ are bounded above by $\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$.
	\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&&-2 &<c<1\\
	&\Rightarrow&\qquad e^{-2} &<e^c<e &\mbox{and } e^{-1}&<e^{-c}<e^2\\
	&\Rightarrow&\qquad f^{(N+1)}(c)&<\frac{e^c+e^{-c}}{2} & &<\frac{e^2+e^2}{2}=e^2<9
	\end{alignat*}

	This bound provides us with a ``worst-case scenario"" error. We don't know exactly what $c$ is, but we don't need to--the bound above holds for \emph{all} $c$ between $-2$ and $1$.

	We also don't know exactly what $x$ will be, only that it's between $-2$ and $1$. So, we note $|x|^{N+1}<2^{N+1}$.

	Now we're ready to choose an $N$ that results in a sufficiently small error bound.

	\text{So, we want:}\qquad \frac{9\cdot2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}&<5\times 10^{-11}
	\end{align*}

	To find an appropriate $N$, we test several values.

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

			$N$&$ \dfrac{9\cdot 2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}$\\ \hline

The model's answer is incorrect for all parts.

**Part (a):** The Maclaurin series derived by the model, $I(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\left(\frac{x^n}{n!}\right)$, is incorrect. The series terms do not match the correct expansion of the integrand. The correct series is $I(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{x^{2n-1}}{(2n)!}$.

**Part (b):** Since the series in (a) is incorrect, the calculation for $I(1)$ is also incorrect. The model states $I(1) = \frac{1}{2}$. This value is simply the first term of the *correct* Maclaurin series for $I(1)$, but it is not an approximation to within $\pm 0.001$. The error for this approximation ($|I(1) - 0.5| \approx 0.0416$) is much larger than the specified tolerance. The correct approximation to within $\pm 0.001$ requires more terms and is approximately $0.460$.

**Part (c):** The model's reasoning for the inequality is incorrect. Given the estimate $1/2$ (the first term of the correct series), the next term in the alternating series for $I(1)$ is $-\frac{1}{4!} \approx -0.0416$. For an alternating series with decreasing terms, if the first neglected term is negative, the true sum is less than the partial sum.

\end{align*}
(Notice, after ten differentiations, the terms $a_0$ and $a_1$ are both zero.)

Since this is an alternating series, the absolute error involved in using the approximation $S_N$ is at most
\[|a_{N+1}|=\frac{(6N+9)!}{(2N+3)(6N-1)!\cdot 5^{6N-1}}\]
By testing a few values of $N$, we find
\[|a_6|=|a_{5+1}|=\frac{39!}{(13)(29!)\cdot 5^{29}}\approx 0.00000095<10^{-6}\]
So, $S_5$ is a sufficient approximation. That is,
\begin{align*}
f^{(10)}\left(\frac15\right)&\approx \sum_{n=2}^5 (-1)^n\frac{(6n+3)!}{(2n+1)(6n-7)!\cdot 5^{6n-7}}\\

**Solution:**

$$f(x)=\arctan(x^3)$$

$$f'(x)=\frac{3x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}$$

$$f''(x)=\frac{6x}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}$$

$$f^{(3)}=\frac{18x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}$$

$$f^{(4)}=\frac{54x}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}$$

Using the Maclaurin series, we have:

$$f(x)=\arctan(x^3)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$$

$$f'(x)=\frac{3x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$$

$$f''(x)=\frac{6x}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}=\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$$

$$f^{(3)}=\frac{18x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}=\sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$$

$$f^{(4)}=\frac{54x}{\sqrt{1+x^6}}=\sum_{n=4}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$$

Evaluating $f(x)=\arctan\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)$, we get:

$$f\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)=\frac{\pi}{3}$$

$$f'(x)=\frac{3\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^6}}=\frac{\pi}{5}$$

$$f''(x)=\frac{6\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^6}}=\frac{\pi}{2}$$

$$f^{(3)}=\frac{18\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^6}}=\frac{\pi}{3}$$

$$f^{(4)}=\frac{54\left(\"," The model makes several fundamental errors:
1.  **Incorrect derivative formula:** The derivative of $\arctan(u)$ is $\frac{u'}{1+u^2}$, not $\frac{u'}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}$ as used by the model for $f'(x)$. This error propagates through all subsequent direct derivative calculations.
2.  **Incorrect Maclaurin series for arctangent:** The model states $\arctan(x^3)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$. This is the Maclaurin series for $e^{-x^3}$, not $\arctan(x^3)$. The correct Maclaurin series for $\arctan(x)$ is $\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$. This is a critical error for the problem.
3.  **Incorrect application of series differentiation:** Even if the series form was correct, the way the model attempts to differentiate the series (e.g., $f'(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}(x^3)^n$) is not a valid method of differentiating a power series term by term.
4.  **Incorrect numerical evaluations:** The numerical evaluations like $f\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)=\frac{\pi}{3}$ are completely incorrect. $f(1/5) = \arctan((1/5)^3) = \arctan(1/125)$, which is a very small number, not $\pi/3$.

Due to these severe errors, the model's solution is not salvageable and does not produce a correct final answer or even a correct approach to finding it. The model also does not provide a final answer in the requested format (sum of rational numbers with a specified error). ",False

\begin{description}
\item[Solution 1:]
We need to show that
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges.
If we replace $n$ by $x$ in the summand, we get $f(x) = 24x^2 e^{-x^3}$,
which we can integate. (Just substitute $u=x^3$.)
So let's try the integral test.
First, we have to check that $f(x)$ is positive and decreasing.
It is certainly positive. To determine if it is decreasing, we compute
\begin{align*}
\diff{f}{x} = 48x e^{-x^3} - 24\times 3 x^4 e^{-x^3}
= 24x (2-3x^3) e^{-x^3}
\end{align*}
which is negative for $x\ge1$. Therefore $f(x)$ is decreasing for $x\ge1$,
and the integral test applies. The substitution $u=x^3$,
$\dee{u}=3x^2\,\,\dee{x}$, yields
\begin{align*}
\int f(x) \,\dee{x}
= \int 24x^2 e^{-x^3} \,\dee{x} = \int 8 e^{-u}\,\dee{u} = -8e^{-u} + C = -8e^{-x^3} + C.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\int_1^\infty f(x) \,\dee{x} &= \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_1^R f(x) \,\dee{x}
  = \lim_{R \to \infty} \bigg[{-}8 e^{-x^3} \bigg]_1^R  \\
   &= \lim_{R \to \infty} ( - 8 e^{-R^3} + 8 e^{-1}  ) = 8 e^{-1}
\end{align*}
Since the integral is convergent, the series
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges
and the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}24n^2 e^{-n^3}$
converges absolutely.

\item[Solution 2:]
Alternatively, we can use the ratio test with $a_n=24n^2 e^{-n^3}$.
We calculate
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{24 (n+1)^2e^{-(n+1)^3}}{24 n^2e^{-n^3}} \right| \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( \frac{(n+1)^2}{n^2} \frac{e^{n^3}}{e^{(n+1)^3}} \right) \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 e^{-(3n^2+3n+1)} = 1\cdot0=0 < 1,
\end{align*}
and therefore the series converges absolutely.

\item[Solution 3:]
Alternatively, alternatively, we can use the limiting comparison test.
First a little intuition building. Recall that we need to show that
$\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ converges. The $n^{\rm th}$
term in this series is
\begin{equation*}
a_n = 24n^2 e^{-n^3} =\frac{24 n^2}{e^{n^3}}
\end{equation*}
It is a ratio with both the numerator and denominator growing with $n$.
A good rule of thumb is that exponentials grow a lot faster than powers.
For example, if $n=10$ the numerator is $2400=2.4\times 10^3$
and the denominator is about $2\times 10^{434}$.
So we would guess that $a_n$ tends to zero as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
The question is ``does $a_n$ tend to zero fast enough with $n$ that our series converges?''. For example, we know that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$
converges (by the $p$--test with $p=2$). So if $a_n$ tends to zero faster
than $\frac{1}{n^2}$ does, our series will converge. So let's try the limiting convergence test with $a_n = 24n^2 e^{-n^3} =\frac{24 n^2}{e^{n^3}}$
and $b_n=\frac{1}{n^2}$.
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{24n^2 e^{-n^3}}{1/n^2}
=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{24n^4 }{e^{n^3}}
\end{align*}
By l'H\^opital's rule, twice,
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{24x^4 }{e^{x^3}}
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{4\times 24x^3 }{3 x^2e^{x^3}}
&\text{by l'H\^opital} \\
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{32x }{e^{x^3}}
&\text{just cleaning up} \\
&=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{32 }{3x^2e^{x^3}}
&\text{by l'H\^opital, again} \\
&=0
\end{align*}
That's it. The limit comparison test now tells us that
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges.

\end{description}

\noindent (b)
In part (a) we saw that $24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ is positive and decreasing.
The limit of this sequence equals $0$ (as can be shown with l'H\^opital's
Rule, just as we did at the end of the third solution of part (a)). Therefore, we can
use the alternating series test, so that the
error made in approximating the infinite sum
$S= \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_n
= \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty  (-1)^{n-1} 24n^2 e^{-n^3}$ by the sum of its first $N$ terms,
$S_N=\sum\limits_{n=1}^N a_n$,  lies between $0$
and the first omitted term, $a_{N+1}$.
If we use $5$ terms, the error satisfies
\begin{align*}
   |S - S_5 | \le |a_6| = 24 \times 36 e^{-6^3}\approx 1.3 \times 10^{-91}

**Answer:**

(a) The series converges absolutely because the general term converges and the series of absolute values converges.

(b) The error resulting from the fifth partial sum is less than

$$\frac{24}{5!} = 9.6$$

for all $n \geq 1$.","
For part (a), the model's answer states a definition of absolute convergence rather than showing or proving it. It essentially says ""it converges absolutely because it converges absolutely,"" which is not a valid argument for a ""show that"" question.

For part (b), the model's formula and calculation for the error bound are incorrect. For an alternating series where the terms $b_n$ are positive, decreasing, and tend to zero, the error in approximating the sum by the Nth partial sum is bounded by the absolute value of the first neglected term, i.e., $|S - S_N| \le b_{N+1}$. In this case, for $S_5$, the upper bound is $b_6 = 24 \times 6^2 e^{-6^3}$. The model's expression $\frac{24}{5!}$ is not relevant to this series' error bound. Furthermore, $24/5! = 24/120 = 0.2$, not $9.6$, so there's also a calculation error in the model's given value.

A surface is given by
\begin{equation*}
z = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 .

\item
Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at $x = a$, $y = 2a$.

\item 
For what value of $a$ is the tangent plane parallel to the plane 
$x - y + z = 1$?

(a)
The surface is $G(x,y,z)=z-x^2+2xy-y^2=0$. When $x=a$ and $y=2a$
 and $(x,y,z)$ is on the surface, we have $z= a^2-2(a)(2a) +(2a)^2=a^2$.
So, by part (c) of Theorem \eref{CLP317}{thm:normalVectors}

a normal vector to this surface at $(a,2a,a^2)$ is

\vnabla G(a,2a,a^2) = ( -2x+2y\,,\,2x-2y\,,\,1)\Big|_{(x,y,z)=(a,2a,a^2)}

**Final Answer:** (a) The equation of the tangent plane is 
$$x - 2y + 4 = 0.$$

(b) The tangent plane is parallel to the plane 
$x - y + z = 1$ when $a = 1$.","
The model's answer for both parts (a) and (b) is incorrect.

For part (a):
The gold answer correctly derives the general equation of the tangent plane in terms of $a$: $2ax - 2ay + z = -a^2$.
The model provides a specific equation $x - 2y + 4 = 0$ which does not contain the variable 'a' and does not match the general form. For example, if we take $a=1/2$ (from the correct answer to part b), the tangent plane equation should be $x - y + z = -1/4$, which is different from the model's answer. The model's answer for (a) is thus incorrect.

For part (b):
The gold answer correctly determines that the normal vector to the tangent plane is $(2a, -2a, 1)$ and the normal vector to the given plane $x - y + z = 1$ is $(1, -1, 1)$. For the planes to be parallel, their normal vectors must be parallel, meaning $(2a, -2a, 1) = k(1, -1, 1)$ for some scalar $k$. From the z-component, $1=k$, which implies $2a=1$ and $-2a=-1$. Both give $a=1/2$. The model states $a=1$, which is incorrect. If $a=1$, the normal vector would be $(2, -2, 1)$, which is not parallel to $(1, -1, 1)$ (it would be $k=2$, but the z-component would require $k=1$).

Friendly (?) bees fly towards your face from all directions. The  speed of each bee is inversely proportional to its distance from your face.  Find a vector field for the velocity of the swarm.
\end{question}","\begin{solution}
Set your face to be at the origin of our coordinate system, $(0,0,0)$. A bee at position $(x,y,z)$ is a distance of $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ from your face, heading in the direction $(-x,-y,-z)$. So, the unit vector indicating the direction of travel of one bee is $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x,y,z)$. Now all we need to find is the length of the velocity vector, i.e. the speed of the bee.

The speed of the friendly bee is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, its distance from your face. (Bees that are closer to you are buzzing towards you more excitedly.) So, the speed is given by $\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$ for some constant $\alpha$. 

The bee velocity has the direction of the unit vector $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x,y,z)$ with length  $\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$ for some positive constant $\alpha$. That is,
\[\vv(x,y,z)=-\frac{\alpha}{{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x,y,z)\]
\end{solution}",Vector Fields,CLP4,"

**Solution:**

Let the position of a bee be given by the vector r(t) = (x(t), y(t)) where (x(t), y(t)) is the position of the bee at time t. Then the velocity of the bee is given by the vector dr/dt = (-dx/dt, -dy/dt).

Since the speed of each bee is inversely proportional to its distance from your face, we have dx/dt = k/|r(t)| and dy/dt = -k/|r(t)| where k is a constant.

Therefore, the velocity vector is:

$$\mathbf{v}(t) = -k\frac{\mathbf{r}(t)}{|\mathbf{r}(t)|}$$

where \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is the position vector of the bee at time t."," The model's final answer for the velocity vector is given as `v(t) = -k * r(t) / |r(t)|`.
Let's analyze the magnitude (speed) of this vector:
`|v(t)| = |-k * r(t) / |r(t)|| = |k| * |r(t)| / |r(t)| = |k|`.
This implies that the speed of the bees is a constant value `|k|`.

However, the question explicitly states: ""The speed of each bee is inversely proportional to its distance from your face.""
If `|r(t)|` is the distance, then the speed should be of the form `alpha / |r(t)|` for some constant `alpha`.

The model's derived speed `|k|` is not inversely proportional to the distance `|r(t)|`. Therefore, the final vector field derived by the model does not satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement regarding the speed.

The gold answer correctly derives the velocity vector as `v(x,y,z) = -alpha * (x,y,z) / (x^2+y^2+z^2)`.
The speed of this vector is `|v(x,y,z)| = |-alpha * r / |r|^2| = |alpha| * |r| / |r|^2 = |alpha| / |r|`, which correctly represents a speed inversely proportional to the distance.

Additionally, the model's initial reasoning `dr/dt = (-dx/dt, -dy/dt)` is mathematically incorrect as a general statement for a position vector `r(t) = (x(t), y(t))`. The velocity is `dr/dt = (dx/dt, dy/dt)`. While the *direction* of the velocity should be towards the origin, the components themselves are positive or negative depending on the quadrant. The overall derivation path is flawed, leading to the incorrect final expression for the velocity field. ",False

3.  **Misunderstanding of the Goal:** The question asks to show `distance between P and Q` = `|∫_C F ⋅ dr|`. The model concludes that the distance between P and Q (for its chosen points) is 1, ""which is the same as the length of the curve C."" This is incorrect for two reasons:
    *   The problem does not ask to equate the distance to the length of the curve C.
    *   The length of the curve C is generally *not* equal to `|∫_C F ⋅ dr|`.

The model fails to utilize the properties of the given vector field (e.g., that it is conservative) and does not correctly approach the line integral. ",False
